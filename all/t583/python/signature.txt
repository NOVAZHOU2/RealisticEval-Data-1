Here's the TypeScript code signature converted to Python, maintaining the code comments for clarity:
python
def remove_query_param(url: str, key: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes the specified parameter from the URL query string.

    :param url: The URL from which to remove the parameter.
    :param key: The key of the parameter to remove.
    :return: The modified URL with the specified parameter removed.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Definition:
def remove_query_param(url: str, key: str) -> str: defines the function in Python.
The parameters url and key are annotated with their types (str), and the return type is also specified as str.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are preserved in the form of a Python docstring, which documents the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is included as a placeholder, indicating where the function's implementation will go.
This Python code signature effectively mirrors the original TypeScript signature, preserving the intent and clarity of the documentation.
