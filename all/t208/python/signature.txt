Hereâ€™s how you can convert the given C++ code signature into Python code signature while keeping the comments intact and changing C++ comment styles to Python comment styles.
Converted Python Code
python
class PriorityQueue:
    """Implement a priority queue"""
    
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    # Function to insert a new element into the priority queue
    def insert(self, value):
        pass
    
    # Function to get and remove the minimum element from the priority queue
    def extract_min(self):
        pass
    
    # Function to peek at the minimum element without removing it
    def peek_min(self):
        pass
    
    # Function to check if the priority queue is empty
    def is_empty(self):
        pass
    
    # Function to get the size of the priority queue
    def size(self):
        pass
    
    # Function to print the contents of the priority queue (for debugging purposes)
    def print(self):
        pass
Changes Made:
Class Declaration: The class definition syntax was changed from C++ to Python.
Constructor: The C++ constructor is replaced with __init__ in Python.
Method Definitions: The method definitions are converted to Python's def keyword.
Method Names: Converted C++ method names to Pythonic naming conventions (e.g., extractMin to extract_min).
Comment Style: C++ style comments (//) were changed to Python style comments (#). The block comment style remains unchanged.
Pass Statement: In Python, pass is used as a placeholder for methods that haven't been implemented yet.
Feel free to ask if you need any further modifications or explanations!
