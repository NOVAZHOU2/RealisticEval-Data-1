Hereâ€™s how to convert the TypeScript function signature to a Python function signature while keeping the code comments intact:
TypeScript Code Signature
typescript
/**
 * Converts a standard Base64 encoded string into a URL-safe Base64 encoded string.
 *
 * @param {string} base64 - The standard Base64 encoded string to be converted.
 * @returns {string} The URL-safe Base64 encoded string.
 */
export function base64ToUrlSafe(base64: string): string {}
Python Code Signature
python
def base64_to_url_safe(base64: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts a standard Base64 encoded string into a URL-safe Base64 encoded string.

    :param base64: The standard Base64 encoded string to be converted.
    :return: The URL-safe Base64 encoded string.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
Changed from base64ToUrlSafe to base64_to_url_safe to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
Function Parameters and Return Type:
The parameter type string in TypeScript becomes str in Python.
The return type string in TypeScript is replaced with -> str in Python, indicating the return type after the parameter list.
Docstring:
The JSDoc comments are converted into a Python docstring, which provides the same description and parameter information. The format for parameters and return values follows standard Python conventions.
Pass Statement:
Added a pass statement in the function body to indicate that the function is currently unimplemented, similar to an empty function body in TypeScript.
This structure maintains clarity and ensures that the function signature and documentation are easily understandable in Python. Let me know if you need further modifications or additional information!
