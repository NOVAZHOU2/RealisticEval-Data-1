Hereâ€™s the JavaScript version of the code signature, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a standard Base64 encoded string into a URL-safe Base64 encoded string.
 *
 * @param {string} base64 - The standard Base64 encoded string to be converted.
 * @returns {string} The URL-safe Base64 encoded string.
 */
export function base64ToUrlSafe(base64) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this version, the type annotations (`: string`) have been removed, while the comments remain unchanged.
