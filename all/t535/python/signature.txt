Sure, here is the Python code signature with the same comments:

```python
"""
Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
while preserving the structure of the HTML.

:param html: The input HTML string to be compressed.
:type html: str
:return: The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
:rtype: str
"""
def compress_html(html):
```

This Python function `compress_html` takes a single parameter `html`, which is expected to be a string, and returns a compressed version of that HTML string. The docstring preserves the original comments from the JavaScript code.
