Here's how you can convert the JavaScript code signature (with JSDoc comments) to a Python function signature, including a docstring to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param {string} html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @returns {string} - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
function compressHtml(html) {}
Equivalent Python Code Signature
python
def compress_html(html: str) -> str:
    """
    Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
    including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
    while preserving the structure of the HTML.

    Args:
        html (str): The input HTML string to be compressed.

    Returns:
        str: The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation:
Function Name: The JavaScript function compressHtml is converted to Python's compress_html.
Type Annotations:
html: str specifies that the parameter html should be a string.
-> str indicates that the function returns a string.
Docstring: The docstring in Python is similar to the JSDoc comments in JavaScript. It describes the function's purpose, the parameter, and the return type.
Function Body: The pass statement serves as a placeholder, indicating that the function implementation will be added later.
You can use this signature in a Python script to define the function and then implement the logic as needed.
