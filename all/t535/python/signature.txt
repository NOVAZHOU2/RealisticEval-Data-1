Sure! Here is the Python code signature for the given JavaScript function, keeping the same comments:

```python
"""
Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
while preserving the structure of the HTML.

:param html: The input HTML string to be compressed.
:type html: str
:return: The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
:rtype: str
"""

def compress_html(html):
    pass
```

This Python function signature uses docstrings to document the parameters, return type, and purpose of the function, similar to how the JavaScript function uses JSDoc comments.
