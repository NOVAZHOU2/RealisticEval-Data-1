Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function `compressHtml`. This Python function will remove unnecessary whitespace from an HTML string while preserving the structure.

```python
import re

def compress_html(html):
    """
    Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
    including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
    while preserving the structure of the HTML.

    :param html: The input HTML string to be compressed.
    :return: The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
    """
    # Remove all whitespaces between tags
    html = re.sub(r'>\s+<', '><', html)
    
    # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces in text nodes
    html = re.sub(r'>(\s*)<', r'><', html)
    
    # Remove multiple consecutive spaces within text nodes
    html = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', html)
    
    return html.strip()

# Example usage:
html_input = "<div>  <p>   Hello World!  </p>  </div>"
compressed_html = compress_html(html_input)
print(compressed_html)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Remove Whitespace Between Tags**: The regular expression `r'>\s+<'` matches any sequence of one or more whitespace characters that appear directly after an opening tag (`>``) and before a closing tag (`<`). The replacement `'><'` removes these whitespace characters.
   
2. **Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespaces in Text Nodes**: The regular expression `r'>(\s*)<'` matches any sequence of zero or more whitespace characters that appear immediately after an opening tag and before a closing tag. The replacement `'><'` removes these whitespace characters.

3. **Remove Multiple Consecutive Spaces Within Text Nodes**: The regular expression `r'\s+'` matches one or more whitespace characters within text nodes and replaces them with a single space.

4. **Strip Leading/Trailing Whitespace**: Finally, `strip()` is called on the result to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the entire HTML string.

This Python function should work similarly to the original JavaScript function, compressing the HTML while preserving its structure.
