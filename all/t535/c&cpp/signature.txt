Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param const std::string& html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @return std::string - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
std::string compressHtml(const std::string& html);
```

This C++ function signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as the original JavaScript function. It takes a constant reference to a `std::string` representing the input HTML and returns a `std::string` that contains the compressed HTML.
