Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param std::string html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @returns std::string - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
std::string compressHtml(const std::string& html) {
}
```

This keeps the original comments and provides the appropriate C++ signature.
