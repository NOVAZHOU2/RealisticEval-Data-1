Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @return std::string - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
std::string compressHtml(const std::string& html);
```

This function takes a `const std::string&` as input (to avoid copying the entire string) and returns a `std::string`.
