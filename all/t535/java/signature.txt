Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param html The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @return The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
public static String compressHtml(String html) {
}
```

This maintains the original structure and comments while adapting it to Java syntax.
