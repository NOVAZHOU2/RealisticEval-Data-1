Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param html The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @return The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
public String compressHtml(String html) {
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same pattern as your JavaScript function, including the docstring that describes what the method does, its parameters, and its return value.
