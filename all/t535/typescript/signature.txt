Sure! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param {string} html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @returns {string} - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
function compressHtml(html: string): string {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've added type annotations for the `html` parameter and the return value, both of which are of type `string`. This helps ensure that the function parameters and return values adhere to the expected data types during development and compilation.
