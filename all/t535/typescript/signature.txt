Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace,
 * including newlines, tabs, and extra spaces,
 * while preserving the structure of the HTML.
 *
 * @param {string} html - The input HTML string to be compressed.
 * @returns {string} - The compressed HTML string with reduced whitespace.
 */
function compressHtml(html: string): string {
}
```

The parameter and return types have been added for TypeScript compatibility. Do you want to explore more about TypeScript features?
