Here's how you can translate your Python function to JavaScript:

```javascript
function sumCalibrationValues(calibrationDocument) {
    /**
     * Sums up calibration values extracted from the document.
     * Each calibration value is formed by combining the first and last digits of numbers found in each line
     * into a two-digit number.
     *
     * @param {string[]} calibrationDocument - An array of strings, each representing a line of text.
     * @returns {number} - The total sum of all calibration values.
     */

    let sum = 0;

    calibrationDocument.forEach(line => {
        const matches = line.match(/\d+/g);
        if (matches && matches.length > 0) {
            matches.forEach(match => {
                const num = parseInt(match[0] + match[match.length - 1], 10);
                sum += num;
            });
        }
    });

    return sum;
}
```

In this JavaScript version, I used `forEach` to iterate over the lines of the calibration document. The regular expression `\d+` is used to find all sequences of digits in each line. If there are any matches, they are converted to integers by taking the first and last characters of each match and then summed up.
