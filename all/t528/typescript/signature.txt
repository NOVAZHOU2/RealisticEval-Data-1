Here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript code:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

/**
 * Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as an array
 *
 * @param {string} dir - The directory path to search in.
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} - A promise that resolves with an array of paths to Markdown files.
 */
async function findMarkdownFiles(dir: string): Promise<string[]> {
    // ... (rest of your code remains unchanged)
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've made the following changes:

1. Imported `fs` and `path` modules using ES6 import syntax.

2. Added type annotations to the function parameters and return value:
   - `dir: string`: This indicates that the `dir` parameter should be a string representing the directory path.
   - `Promise<string[]>`: This indicates that the function will return a promise that resolves with an array of strings representing the paths to Markdown files.

3. Changed the function name to `findMarkdownFiles` to match the original JavaScript code. If you want to use a different name, feel free to modify it accordingly.
