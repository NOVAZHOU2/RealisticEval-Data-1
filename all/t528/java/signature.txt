Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as an array
 *
 * @param dir The directory path to search in.
 * @return A list of paths to Markdown files.
 */
public List<String> findMarkdownFiles(String dir) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This Java method `findMarkdownFiles` takes a directory path as input and returns a list of paths to Markdown files within that directory. The comments have been preserved from the original JavaScript function.
