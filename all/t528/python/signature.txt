To convert the JavaScript function signature and its accompanying documentation into a Python function signature with a similar docstring format, you can follow the structure below:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

/**
 * Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as an array
 *
 * @param {string} dir - The directory path to search in.
 * @returns {string[]} - An array of paths to Markdown files.
 */
function findMarkdownFiles(dir) {}
Python Code Signature
Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code signature using a docstring:
python
import os

def find_markdown_files(dir_path: str) -> list:
    """
    Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the paths of the files as a list.

    Args:
        dir_path (str): The directory path to search in.

    Returns:
        list: A list of paths to Markdown files.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Imports:
In Python, we use import os instead of const fs = require('fs'); const path = require('path'); to import necessary modules.
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def instead of function, and it uses the snake_case naming convention commonly found in Python (find_markdown_files instead of findMarkdownFiles).
Parameters and Return Type:
The parameter dir in JavaScript is changed to dir_path in Python for clarity, with an explicit type annotation str.
The return type is also specified using a type annotation -> list, indicating that the function returns a list.
Docstring:
The docstring format in Python is used to describe the function's purpose, arguments, and return type, similar to the JSDoc style in JavaScript.
Placeholder Implementation:
A pass statement is included to indicate that this is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the function.
Final Python Function Signature
This Python function signature can be implemented similarly to the JavaScript version but will conform to Python's syntax and conventions.
