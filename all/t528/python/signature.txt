Sure, here is the Python equivalent of your JavaScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```python
import os

def find_markdown_files(dir):
    """
    Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as a list.

    :param str dir: The directory path to search in.
    :return: A list of paths to Markdown files.
    :rtype: list[str]
    """
```

This Python function `find_markdown_files` takes a single argument `dir`, which is expected to be a string representing the directory path to search within. It returns a list of strings where each string is the path to a Markdown file found in the specified directory.
