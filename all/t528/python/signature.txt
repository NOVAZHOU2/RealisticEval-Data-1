Here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to Python, keeping the comments:

```python
import os

def find_markdown_files(directory):
    """
    Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as an array

    :param str directory: The directory path to search in.
    :return: A list of paths to Markdown files.
    :rtype: list[str]
    """
```

This Python version uses the `os` module instead of `fs` and `path`, which are specific to Node.js. The function is defined with a docstring that matches the original JavaScript comment block. Note that in Python, type hints are used to specify the types of the parameters and return value.
