Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code using the `os` module to achieve the same functionality:

```python
import os

def find_markdown_files(directory):
    """
    Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as an array.

    :param directory: The directory path to search in.
    :return: A list of paths to Markdown files.
    """
    markdown_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.md'):
                markdown_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    return markdown_files
```

This function uses `os.walk()` to traverse the directory tree rooted at `directory`, and checks each file to see if it ends with `.md`. If it does, the full path to that file is added to the `markdown_files` list, which is then returned.
