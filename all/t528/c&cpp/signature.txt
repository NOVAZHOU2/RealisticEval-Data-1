Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same functionality and comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

/**
 * Searches for Markdown files in the specified directory and returns the path of the files as a vector
 *
 * @param {std::string} dir - The directory path to search in.
 * @returns {std::vector<std::string>} - A vector of paths to Markdown files.
 */
std::vector<std::string> findMarkdownFiles(const std::string& dir);
```

This C++ code uses the `<filesystem>` library to handle file system operations, which is available in modern C++17 and later versions. If you're using an older version of C++, you might need to include additional libraries or use platform-specific APIs.
