Here's the C++ code signature converted to a Python code signature while keeping the comments and converting them to Python-style comments:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def get_current_date() -> str:
    """
    Retrieves the current system date and formats it as a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

    :return: A string representing the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
Changed from getCurrentDate (C++) to get_current_date (Python) to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Return Type:
The return type annotation -> str indicates that the function returns a string, similar to std::string in C++.
Docstring:
The comments were converted to a Python docstring format using triple quotes """ to describe the function's purpose and its return value.
The @return tag was changed to the :return: format commonly used in Python docstrings.
Placeholder:
A pass statement was added as a placeholder for the function implementation, indicating that it will be filled in later.
This format adheres to Python conventions while preserving the original intent of the comments.
