Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature and comments adapted from the provided C++ code:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves the current system date and formats it as a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
 *
 * @return A string representing the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
 */
function getCurrentDate(): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Declaration**: The `std::string` return type in C++ is replaced with `string` in TypeScript.
2. **Comment Style**: C++ comments are converted to TypeScript comment styles, maintaining the original formatting.
3. **No Memory Management**: TypeScript handles memory automatically, so there are no pointers or manual memory management as in C++. 

This keeps the structure and functionality intact while following TypeScript conventions.
