Sure, here's the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Decompose a flat index `n` into a multidimensional index based on the given shape.
 *
 * @param n - Flat index (non-negative integer).
 * @param shape - Array representing the dimensions of the multi-dimensional array.
 * @returns A tuple representing the multidimensional index corresponding to `n`.
 * @throws Error if `n` is out of bounds for the array defined by `shape`.
 */
function decompose(n: number, shape: number[]): number[];
```

This TypeScript function signature mirrors the Python one, including the parameter types and return type, while also keeping the docstring comments intact.
