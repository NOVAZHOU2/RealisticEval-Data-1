Sure! Below is an example of how you might convert a Python unittest test case to a C++ Catch2 test case. This example assumes that you have a function called `decompose` that takes an integer `n` and a tuple `shape`, and returns a tuple representing the multidimensional index corresponding to `n`.

First, let's define the `decompose` function in C++. For simplicity, I'll assume it throws an exception if `n` is out of bounds.

```cpp
#include <tuple>
#include <stdexcept>

std::tuple<int, int> decompose(int n, std::tuple<int, int> shape) {
    int rows = std::get<0>(shape);
    int cols = std::get<1>(shape);

    if (n < 0 || n >= rows * cols) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Index out of bounds");
    }

    int row = n / cols;
    int col = n % cols;

    return {row, col};
}
```

Now, let's write the Catch2 test cases:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"

TEST_CASE("decompose function", "[decompose]") {
    // Test with valid input
    SECTION("Valid input") {
        auto result = decompose(5, std::make_tuple(3, 4));
        REQUIRE(result == std::make_tuple(1, 1));

        result = decompose(7, std::make_tuple(2, 4));
        REQUIRE(result == std::make_tuple(1, 3));
    }

    // Test with invalid input
    SECTION("Invalid input") {
        REQUIRE_THROWS(decompose(-1, std::make_tuple(3, 4)));
        REQUIRE_THROWS(decompose(12, std::make_tuple(3, 4)));

        REQUIRE_THROWS(decompose(5, std::make_tuple(2, 4)));
    }
}
```

In this C++ code:
- We include the necessary headers.
- We define the `decompose` function.
- We use the `TEST_CASE` macro to create a test case named "decompose function".
- Inside the test case, we use `SECTION` to group related tests.
- We use `REQUIRE` to check if the output of `decompose` matches the expected result.
- We use `REQUIRE_THROWS` to check if the function throws an exception when given invalid input.

Make sure you have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your project to compile and run these tests.
