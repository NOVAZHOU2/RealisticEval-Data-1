Here is the equivalent C++ code for the provided Python function:

```cpp
#include <tuple>
#include <stdexcept>

// Decompose a flat index `n` into a multidimensional index based on the given shape.
// 
// Args:
//     n: Flat index (non-negative integer).
//     shape: std::tuple representing the dimensions of the multi-dimensional array.
// 
// Returns:
//     std::tuple: std::tuple representing the multidimensional index corresponding to `n`.
// 
// Throws:
//     std::out_of_range: If `n` is out of bounds for the array defined by `shape`.
std::tuple<int, int, int> decompose(int n, const std::tuple<int, int, int>& shape) {
    // Implementation goes here.
    // Ensure that n is within the bounds of the array defined by shape.
    // Convert n into a multidimensional index according to the shape.
    
    // Example implementation (for demonstration purposes):
    int dim1 = std::get<0>(shape);
    int dim2 = std::get<1>(shape);
    int dim3 = std::get<2>(shape);

    if (n < 0 || n >= dim1 * dim2 * dim3) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Index is out of bounds.");
    }

    int idx1 = n / (dim2 * dim3);
    int idx2 = (n % (dim2 * dim3)) / dim3;
    int idx3 = n % dim3;

    return std::make_tuple(idx1, idx2, idx3);
}
```

### Notes:
- The Python `Tuple` type annotation is translated into a fixed-size `std::tuple<int, int, int>` in C++. If the tuple size is variable, you would need to use a different approach, such as a `std::vector<int>`.
- The Python `ValueError` is translated into a `std::out_of_range` exception in C++.
- The Python docstring is converted into a C++ style comment block.
- The function assumes a three-dimensional shape for simplicity; you may generalize this for any dimensionality as needed.
