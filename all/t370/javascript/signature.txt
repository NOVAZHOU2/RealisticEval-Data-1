Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Decompose a flat index `n` into a multidimensional index based on the given shape.
 *
 * @param {number} n - Flat index (non-negative integer).
 * @param {Array<number>} shape - Array representing the dimensions of the multi-dimensional array.
 * @returns {Array<number>} An array representing the multidimensional index corresponding to `n`.
 * @throws {Error} If `n` is out of bounds for the array defined by `shape`.
 */
function decompose(n, shape) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note that in JavaScript, we use `Array<number>` instead of `Tuple` since JavaScript does not have a native tuple type. The rest of the function implementation would follow similar logic as the Python code, but adapted to JavaScript syntax.
