Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript function with the same signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Decompose a flat index `n` into a multidimensional index based on the given shape.
 *
 * @param {number} n - Flat index (non-negative integer).
 * @param {Array<number>} shape - Array representing the dimensions of the multi-dimensional array.
 * @returns {Array<number>} - Array representing the multidimensional index corresponding to `n`.
 * @throws {Error} - If `n` is out of bounds for the array defined by `shape`.
 */
function decompose(n, shape) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments to document functions, similar to Python's docstrings. The `@param` tag is used to describe each parameter, and the `@returns` tag describes the return value. The `@throws` tag is used to indicate that the function can throw an error under certain conditions.
