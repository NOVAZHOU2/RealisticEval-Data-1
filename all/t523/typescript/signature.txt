Here is the equivalent TypeScript code signature for your Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Translate the point cloud by a given vector.
 *
 * @param pointCloud - A N x 3 array representing the 3D point cloud.
 * @param translationVector - A 1 x 3 array or list representing the translation vector.
 * @returns A N x 3 array of the translated point cloud.
 */
function translatePointCloud(pointCloud: number[][], translationVector: number[]): number[][] {
```

Please note that TypeScript does not have a built-in type for NumPy arrays like Python does. Instead, we use `number[][]` which represents a two-dimensional array of numbers, similar to how you would represent a matrix in JavaScript/TypeScript. If you need more specific types for handling 3D points and vectors, you might consider creating custom interfaces or types.
