Here is your Python code converted into JavaScript using the Three.js library:

```javascript
function translatePointCloud(pointCloud, translationVector) {
    /**
     * Translate the point cloud by a given vector.
     *
     * @param {Array} pointCloud - An array of objects representing the 3D point cloud with properties 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
     * @param {Array} translationVector - An array representing the translation vector with elements 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
     *
     * @returns {Array} - An array of objects of the translated point cloud.
     */
    
    return pointCloud.map(point => ({
        x: point.x + translationVector[0],
        y: point.y + translationVector[1],
        z: point.z + translationVector[2]
    }));
}
```

This function takes in an array of objects representing the 3D point cloud where each object has properties 'x', 'y' and 'z'. It also takes in an array representing the translation vector with elements 'x', 'y' and 'z'. The function returns an array of objects of the translated point cloud. Each object's coordinates have been updated according to the provided translation vector.
