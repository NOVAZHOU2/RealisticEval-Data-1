To convert the Java method in the Answer class to Python, we need to adjust the syntax and types accordingly. Here's how the provided Java code translates to Python:
Java Code
java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    public static double bezier(double t, double p0, double p1, double p2, double p3) {
        double d = 1 - t;
        return p0 * d * d * d + 3 * p1 * d * d * t + 3 * p2 * d * t * t + p3 * t * t * t;
    }
}
Python Code
In Python, the equivalent code would look like this:
python
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def bezier(t: float, p0: float, p1: float, p2: float, p3: float) -> float:
        d = 1 - t
        return (p0 * d * d * d +
                3 * p1 * d * d * t +
                3 * p2 * d * t * t +
                p3 * t * t * t)
Explanation of Changes
Class Definition: The Answer class remains the same but does not require a package declaration.
Method Definition:
In Python, the method is defined using def instead of Java's public static double.
The @staticmethod decorator is used to indicate that bezier is a static method, similar to its Java counterpart.
Parameter Types: The types for parameters are specified with type hints (float), which is common in Python for clarity but not strictly enforced.
Return Type: The return type is also indicated with a type hint (-> float).
Mathematical Operations: The logic remains the same, but indentation is used to format the code properly in Python.
Usage
You can call this method in Python like so:
python
result = Answer.bezier(0.5, 0, 1, 2, 3)
print(result)  # Output will be the result of the cubic Bezier calculation
This implementation replicates the functionality of the original Java method while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
