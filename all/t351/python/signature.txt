To convert the Java function signature you provided into Python, we will follow Python's syntax for defining functions, including parameter typing and docstring formatting. Hereâ€™s how the Java function signature translates into Python:
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Calculates the value of a cubic Bezier curve at a given parameter t.
 *
 * @param t  The parameter value between 0 and 1 that represents a position along the curve.
 * @param p0 The first control point of the curve, typically where the curve starts.
 * @param p1 The second control point, which influences the tangent at the beginning of the curve.
 * @param p2 The third control point, which influences the tangent at the end of the curve.
 * @param p3 The fourth control point, typically where the curve ends.
 * @return The point on the Bezier curve corresponding to the parameter t.
 */
public static double bezier(double t, double p0, double p1, double p2, double p3) {}
Python Function Signature
python
def bezier(t: float, p0: float, p1: float, p2: float, p3: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the value of a cubic Bezier curve at a given parameter t.

    :param t: The parameter value between 0 and 1 that represents a position along the curve.
    :param p0: The first control point of the curve, typically where the curve starts.
    :param p1: The second control point, which influences the tangent at the beginning of the curve.
    :param p2: The third control point, which influences the tangent at the end of the curve.
    :param p3: The fourth control point, typically where the curve ends.
    :return: The point on the Bezier curve corresponding to the parameter t.
    """
    pass  # Implementation would go here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition: The public static double bezier from Java is translated to def bezier in Python. The public and static keywords are not needed in Python.
Type Annotations: Each parameter is annotated with float types, and the return type is indicated with -> float.
Docstring Format: Python uses triple quotes for docstrings, which provide documentation for the function, including parameters and return values, similar to Java's Javadoc comments.
Implementation Placeholder: The pass statement is used as a placeholder where the actual implementation would go.
Example Usage
This function can then be called in Python like so:
python
result = bezier(0.5, 0, 1, 2, 3)
This signature defines the method correctly in Python while maintaining the documentation style and clarity provided in the original Java code.
