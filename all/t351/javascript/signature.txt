Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments, preserving the purpose and structure of the original Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the value of a cubic Bezier curve at a given parameter t.
 *
 * @param {number} t - The parameter value between 0 and 1 that represents a position along the curve.
 * @param {number} p0 - The first control point of the curve, typically where the curve starts.
 * @param {number} p1 - The second control point, which influences the tangent at the beginning of the curve.
 * @param {number} p2 - The third control point, which influences the tangent at the end of the curve.
 * @param {number} p3 - The fourth control point, typically where the curve ends.
 * @returns {number} The point on the Bezier curve corresponding to the parameter t.
 */
function bezier(t, p0, p1, p2, p3) {
    const d = 1 - t;
    return (p0 * d * d * d +
            3 * p1 * d * d * t +
            3 * p2 * d * t * t +
            p3 * t * t * t);
}
```

This JavaScript version maintains the same functionality and structure as the original Python code, with appropriate comments formatted for JSDoc.
