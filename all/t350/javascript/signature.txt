Here’s the equivalent JavaScript function signature along with the comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a byte array into its corresponding hexadecimal string representation.
 *
 * @param {Uint8Array} byteArray - An array of bytes to be converted into a hexadecimal string.
 * @returns {string} A string representing the hexadecimal values of the bytes in the input array. If the input array is empty, returns an empty string.
 */
function byteArrayToHexString(byteArray) {
    let hexString = byteArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0').toUpperCase()).join('');
    return hexString;
}
```

### Changes Made:
- The function signature was adjusted to JavaScript syntax.
- Python type hints were removed, as JavaScript doesn’t support them in the same way.
- The comments were converted to JSDoc format for documentation purposes.
