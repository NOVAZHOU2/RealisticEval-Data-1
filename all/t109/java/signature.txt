Certainly! Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved, along with the method signature:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Returns the object from the list with the given ID, or null if it is not present.
 *
 * @param id  The `id` to search for in the list.
 * @param list The list of objects to search through.
 * @return The object with the matching `id`, or `null` if no match is found.
 */
public static Map<String, Object> getObjectById(Object id, List<Map<String, Object>> list) {
    // Method body goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**:
   - `List` is used to represent the list of objects.
   - `Map` is used to represent each object.

2. **Method Signature**:
   - The method `getObjectById` takes two parameters:
     - `id`: The ID to search for in the list.
     - `list`: The list of objects to search through.
   - The method returns a `Map<String, Object>` or `null`.

3. **Comments**:
   - The Javadoc comments are preserved to provide documentation for the method.

This code signature can be used as a starting point for implementing the method body.
