Hereâ€™s the Java method signature with comments, adapted from your JavaScript code:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Returns the object from the list with the given ID, or null if it is not present.
 *
 * @param id   The `id` to search for in the list.
 * @param list The list of objects to search through.
 * @return The object with the matching `id`, or `null` if no match is found.
 */
public static Object getObjectById(Object id, List<Object> list) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```
