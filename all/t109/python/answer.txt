Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function getObjectById into Python code. The Python version will use a simple loop to search through a list of dictionaries (which are equivalent to objects in JavaScript).
Converted Python Code
python
def get_object_by_id(id, obj_list):
    """
    Returns the object from the list with the given ID, or None if it is not present.

    Args:
        id (str | int): The `id` to search for in the list.
        obj_list (list[dict]): The list of objects to search through.

    Returns:
        dict | None: The object with the matching `id`, or None if no match is found.
    """
    # Iterate over the list of objects
    for obj in obj_list:
        # Check if the object has an `id` key that matches the given id
        if 'id' in obj and obj['id'] == id:
            # If a match is found, return the object
            return obj
    
    # If no match is found, return None
    return None

# Example usage
objects = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Object 1'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Object 2'},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Object 3'}
]

# Test the function
print(get_object_by_id(2, objects))  # Output: {'id': 2, 'name': 'Object 2'}
print(get_object_by_id(4, objects))  # Output: None
Explanation of the Code:
Function Definition: The function get_object_by_id is defined to take two parameters: id (the ID to search for) and obj_list (the list of objects represented as dictionaries).
Docstring:
The docstring describes the function's purpose, the arguments it takes, and what it returns.
It uses type hints to specify the types of parameters and return values.
Iteration:
The function iterates over each dictionary in the obj_list using a for loop.
Condition Check:
It checks if the dictionary contains the key 'id' and if the value associated with that key matches the provided id.
Return Value:
If a match is found, the corresponding dictionary (object) is returned.
If no match is found after checking all objects, None is returned, which is the equivalent of null in JavaScript.
Example Usage:
A list of example objects is created, and the function is tested with both a valid and an invalid ID.
This Python code provides similar functionality to the original JavaScript code while adhering to Python conventions. You can test the function with different input values as needed!
