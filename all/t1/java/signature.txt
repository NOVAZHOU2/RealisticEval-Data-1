Here's the equivalent Java method signature with the same functionality and comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts the input string, first checking if it can be converted to an integer.
 * If not, checks if it can be converted to a floating-point number.
 * If neither conversion is possible, returns the original string.
 *
 * @param value The input string to convert.
 * @return An int, float, or String based on the successful conversion or the original value.
 */
public Object numericalStrConvert(String value) {
```

Note that in Java, we use `Object` instead of `Union[int, float, str]` because Java doesn't have built-in support for union types like Python does. We also need to handle the type conversions manually within the method body.
