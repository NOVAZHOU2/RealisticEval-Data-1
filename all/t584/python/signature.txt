Hereâ€™s how to convert the TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while retaining the comments:
TypeScript Code Signature
typescript
/**
 * Detects whether the string is in PASCAL_CASE.
 *
 * @param {string} input - The string to check.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the string is in PASCAL_CASE, otherwise false.
 */
function isPascalCase(input: string): boolean {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def is_pascal_case(input: str) -> bool:
    """
    Detects whether the string is in PASCAL_CASE.

    :param input: The string to check.
    :return: True if the string is in PASCAL_CASE, otherwise False.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function name is converted from isPascalCase (CamelCase) to is_pascal_case (snake_case) to follow Python naming conventions.
The parameter input is typed as str, and the return type is specified as bool.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are transformed into a docstring format, which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
The @param and @returns annotations are changed to :param and :return, which is the convention in Python docstrings.
Placeholder Implementation:
The function body contains pass, which is a placeholder indicating that the implementation will be added later.
This Python code signature accurately reflects the original TypeScript signature while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
