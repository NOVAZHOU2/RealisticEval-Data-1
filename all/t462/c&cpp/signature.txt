Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

/**
 * @brief Given a 2D matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
 *
 * @param matrix A 2D vector of integers.
 * @return std::vector<int> A vector of integers representing the matrix elements in spiral order.
 */
std::vector<int> spiralOrder(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix);
```

This function takes a constant reference to a 2D vector of integers and returns a vector of integers representing the elements of the matrix in spiral order. The comments have been preserved to maintain clarity.
