Here is the JavaScript version of your Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Given a 2D array, return all elements of the array in spiral order.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} matrix - A 2D array of integers.
 * @returns {number[]} An array of integers representing the array elements in spiral order.
 */
function spiralOrder(matrix) {
```

This JavaScript function has the same purpose and parameters as your original Python function, but it uses JavaScript syntax and conventions. The docstring is also converted to JSDoc format, which is commonly used for documenting JavaScript code.
