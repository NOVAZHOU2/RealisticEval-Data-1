Sure! Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Analyze an array of pixels, each represented by RGB, and calculate the proportion of red in the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} pixels - An array of pixels, where each pixel is represented as an array [R, G, B].
 * @returns {number} The proportion of red in the array of pixels, as a value between 0 and 1.
 */
function calculateRedProportion(pixels) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as the original Python function.
