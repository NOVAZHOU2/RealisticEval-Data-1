Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python function:

```javascript
function calculateRedProportion(pixels) {
    /*
     * Analyze an array of pixels, each represented by RGB values, 
     * and calculate the proportion of red in the array.
     *
     * @param {Array<Array<number>>} pixels - An array of pixels,
     * where each pixel is represented as an array of [R, G, B].
     *
     * @return {number} The proportion of red in the array of pixels,
     * as a value between 0 and 1.
     */
    
    let totalPixels = pixels.length;
    let redCount = 0;

    pixels.forEach(pixel => {
        if (pixel[0] > 0) {
            redCount++;
        }
    });

    return redCount / totalPixels;
}
```
This JavaScript function works similarly to your Python function. It calculates the proportion of pixels that have a non-zero red component out of all pixels. Please note that the RGB color model used here considers any positive R value as "red". If you want to consider only fully red pixels (i.e., R=255), you can modify the condition inside the `forEach` loop accordingly.
