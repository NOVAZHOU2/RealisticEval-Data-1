Here's how you can translate the Python code signature into Java:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.awt.Color;

/**
 * Analyze a list of pixels, each represented by RGB, and calculate the proportion of red in the list.
 *
 * @param pixels A list of pixels, where each pixel is represented as an instance of Color.
 * @return The proportion of red in the list of pixels, as a value between 0 and 1.
 */
public static double calculateRedProportion(List<Color> pixels) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In this Java version, I've used `Color` class from `java.awt` package which represents colors in the default sRGB color space. Also, the method return type has been changed to `double` instead of `float`.
