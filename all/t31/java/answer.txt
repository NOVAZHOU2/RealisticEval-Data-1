Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code for the given Python function:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.List;
import java.awt.Color;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Analyze a list of pixels, each represented by RGB values, and calculate the proportion of red in the list.
     *
     * @param pixels A list of pixels, where each pixel is represented as an array of [R, G, B].
     * @return The proportion of red in the list of pixels, as a value between 0 and 1.
     */
    public static double calculateRedProportion(List<int[]> pixels) {
        if (pixels == null || pixels.isEmpty()) {
            return 0.0;
        }

        int totalPixels = pixels.size();
        int redCount = 0;

        for (int[] pixel : pixels) {
            if (pixel.length != 3) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Each pixel must have exactly three components (RGB).");
            }
            int r = pixel[0];
            int g = pixel[1];
            int b = pixel[2];

            // Assuming red is defined as having more than 50% of the maximum color intensity
            if (r > 50 && g < 50 && b < 50) {
                redCount++;
            }
        }

        return (double) redCount / totalPixels;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<int[]> pixels = List.of(
                new int[]{255, 0, 0},
                new int[]{0, 255, 0},
                new int[]{0, 0, 255},
                new int[]{255, 0, 0}
        );

        double proportion = calculateRedProportion(pixels);
        System.out.println("Proportion of red pixels: " + proportion);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The package declaration is set to `org.real.temp`.
2. **Class Declaration**: The class `Answer` contains the method `calculateRedProportion`.
3. **Method Signature**: The method takes a `List<int[]>` where each `int[]` represents an RGB pixel.
4. **Null and Empty Check**: The method checks if the input list is null or empty and returns 0.0 if true.
5. **Pixel Counting**: It iterates through the list of pixels, counting how many pixels are considered "red" based on the condition that the red component is greater than 50 and the green and blue components are less than 50.
6. **Return Proportion**: The method calculates and returns the proportion of red pixels as a double.

This Java code should provide the same functionality as the original Python function.
