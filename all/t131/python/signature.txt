To convert the JavaScript function signature into a Python function signature, you'll need to adjust the syntax accordingly. In JavaScript, a function is defined with the function keyword, whereas in Python, functions are defined using the def keyword.
Hereâ€™s the conversion:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Add a CSS rule to the HTML document to highlight search results
 */
function checkCSSHighlightAndAdd() {}
Python Code Signature
python
def check_css_highlight_and_add():
    """
    Add a CSS rule to the HTML document to highlight search results
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for function implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition: The function keyword is replaced with def.
Function Name: The function name is converted from camelCase (checkCSSHighlightAndAdd) to snake_case (check_css_highlight_and_add), which is the convention in Python.
Docstring: The comment block (/** ... */) is replaced with a docstring using triple quotes (""" ... """) in Python, which serves the same purpose of describing the function's purpose.
Function Body: The empty body of the function in JavaScript ({}) is replaced with pass, which is a placeholder in Python to indicate that the function is intentionally left unimplemented.
This Python function signature now accurately reflects the intent of the original JavaScript code while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
