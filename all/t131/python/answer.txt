To convert the provided JavaScript code that adds a CSS rule to the HTML document into Python, we need to consider that Python is not typically used for manipulating HTML documents directly, as JavaScript is in a web browser environment. However, if you're working with web development in Python, you might be using a framework like Flask or Django, or manipulating HTML using a library like Beautiful Soup or even generating HTML using a template engine.
Assuming you want to represent similar logic in Python, here's how you can approach it. This example will demonstrate how you might check for a CSS rule and add it using a simple class structure, while considering the fact that Python does not natively manipulate the DOM:
Python Equivalent Code
python
class CSSManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.css_rule_exists_for_highlight = False
        self.styles = []

    def check_css_highlight_and_add(self):
        # Check if the CSS rule already exists
        if not self.css_rule_exists_for_highlight:
            print("CSS rule not found, adding it now")
            # Create a new CSS rule
            css_rule = (
                "::highlight(search-result-highlight) {"
                " background-color: yellow;"
                " color: black;"
                "}"
            )
            # Append the CSS rule to the styles
            self.styles.append(css_rule)
            # Update the flag to indicate that the CSS rule now exists
            self.css_rule_exists_for_highlight = True

# Example usage
css_manager = CSSManager()
css_manager.check_css_highlight_and_add()

# Output the styles
for style in css_manager.styles:
    print(style)
Explanation:
Class Structure: We define a class CSSManager to encapsulate the CSS management logic.
Initialization: The __init__ method initializes the css_rule_exists_for_highlight flag and a list styles to hold CSS rules.
Method to Check and Add CSS:
The method check_css_highlight_and_add checks whether the CSS rule already exists.
If not, it prints a message, defines the new CSS rule, and appends it to the styles list.
It then sets the flag to indicate that the CSS rule now exists.
Example Usage: An instance of CSSManager is created, and the method is called to demonstrate how it works.
Output: Finally, we print the CSS rules that have been added.
Important Note:
This Python code is a simulation of the JavaScript functionality, designed to maintain a similar logic flow. In real-world applications, if you are dynamically adding styles to HTML documents in a web context, you would typically do this through a front-end technology (like JavaScript) or via server-side rendering templates that include the necessary CSS directly in the HTML response.
