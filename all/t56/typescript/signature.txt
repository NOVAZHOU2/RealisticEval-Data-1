Sure! Here is the TypeScript version of your Python code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Find all the characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS, but not in GBK, and return them as an array.
 *
 * @returns {string[]} - An array of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS, not encodable in GBK.
 */
```

In TypeScript, we use JSDoc-style comments for documentation. The `@returns` tag specifies the type of the value returned by the function. In this case, it's an array of strings (`string[]`).
