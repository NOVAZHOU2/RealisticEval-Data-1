Here is the equivalent Java method signature:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class MyClass {

    /**
     * Find all the characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS, but not in GBK, and return them as an array
     *
     * @return A list of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS, not encodable in GBK.
     */
    public static List<Character> findShiftJisNotGbk() {
        // Method implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Please note that unlike Python, Java does not support type hinting natively. Therefore, I've replaced `List` with `List<Character>` for better readability.

Also, you need to replace `MyClass` with your actual class name where you want to define this method.
