Sure! Here is the JavaScript code signature with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Find all the characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS, but not in GBK, and return them as an array.
 *
 * @returns {string[]} - An array of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS, not encodable in GBK.
 */
function findShiftJisNotGbk() {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature maintains the same purpose and documentation as the original Python function.
