Here is how you might convert the Python code into JavaScript:

```javascript
function findShiftJisNotGbk() {
    // Define your character ranges here
    var shiftJisChars = "Your Shift-JIS characters range";
    var gbkChars = "Your GBK characters range";

    var result = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < shiftJisChars.length; i++) {
        if (gbkChars.indexOf(shiftJisChars[i]) === -1) {
            result.push(shiftJisChars[i]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

Please note that you need to replace `"Your Shift-JIS characters range"` and `"Your GBK characters range"` with actual strings containing all possible characters in Shift-JIS and GBK respectively.

This JavaScript function works similarly to the Python one: it iterates over each character in the Shift-JIS string and checks whether it's present in the GBK string. If it isn't, the character is added to the result array. Finally, the function returns the array of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS and not encodable in GBK.
