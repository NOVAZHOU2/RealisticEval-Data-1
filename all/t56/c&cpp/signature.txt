Sure, here is the C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * find all the characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS, but not in GBK, and return them as an array
 *
 * @return std::vector<char>: A vector of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS, not encodable in GBK.
 */
std::vector<char> findShiftJisNotGbk();
```

This function signature uses `std::vector<char>` instead of Python's `List` to represent the list of characters. The rest of the comment remains unchanged.
