Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code for the given Python function, including the function signature, comments, and documentation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <codecvt>
#include <locale>

// Function to find all characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS but not in GBK
// and return them as a vector.
std::vector<wchar_t> find_shiftjis_not_gbk() {
    /*
     * find all the characters that can be represented in Shift-JIS, but not in GBK, and return them as an array
     *
     * Returns:
     *     std::vector<wchar_t>: A vector of characters that are unique to Shift-JIS, not encodable in GBK.
     */

    // List to store characters that are in Shift-JIS but not in GBK
    std::vector<wchar_t> unique_to_shiftjis;

    // Iterate over a range of Unicode code points
    // The BMP goes up to U+FFFF, which is 65535 in decimal
    for (int codepoint = 0; codepoint < 65536; ++codepoint) {
        wchar_t character = static_cast<wchar_t>(codepoint);

        try {
            // Try encoding the character in Shift-JIS
            std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> converter;
            std::string shiftjis_encoded = converter.to_bytes(character);
            std::locale loc("ja_JP.shift_jis");
            if (!std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(loc).is(std::ctype_base::print, character)) {
                throw std::runtime_error("Character not representable in Shift-JIS");
            }

                if (!std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(gbk_loc).is(std::ctype_base::print, character)) {
                    throw std::runtime_error("Character not representable in GBK");
                }
            } catch (const std::runtime_error&) {
                // If it fails, the character is not representable in GBK but is in Shift-JIS
                unique_to_shiftjis.push_back(character);
            }
        } catch (const std::runtime_error&) {
            // If it fails, the character is not representable in Shift-JIS, so we skip it
            continue;
        }
    }

    return unique_to_shiftjis;
}

int main() {
    auto result = find_shiftjis_not_gbk();
    for (wchar_t c : result) {
        std::wcout << c << L" ";

### Explanation:
1. **Headers**: The necessary headers are included.
   - `<iostream>` for input/output operations.
   - `<vector>` for using `std::vector`.
   - `<codecvt>` for converting between wide and narrow strings.
   - `<locale>` for locale-specific character encoding checks.

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - Single-line comment for the function description.
   - Multi-line comment for the detailed description and return value.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `find_shiftjis_not_gbk` is defined to find characters that are representable in Shift-JIS but not in GBK.

4. **Loop**: A loop iterates over the range of Unicode code points from 0 to 65535.

5. **Character Encoding Checks**:
   - Each character is encoded in Shift-JIS and checked for printability.
   - If the character is printable in Shift-JIS, it is then checked for printability in GBK.
   - Characters that are printable in Shift-JIS but not in GBK are added to the `unique_to_shiftjis` vector.

6. **Main Function**: The `main` function calls `find_shiftjis_not_gbk` and prints the resulting characters.

This code preserves the original purpose and structure of the Python code, with appropriate C++ syntax and documentation.
