Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ unit test case using Catch2 for your Python `unittest` test class.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed in your project. If you're using a package manager like vcpkg or conan, you can install it easily. For simplicity, let's assume you've included Catch2 directly in your project.

Here's how you might write the equivalent C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Assuming this function is implemented somewhere in your project
std::vector<char> findShiftJisNotGbk();

TEST_CASE("findShiftJisNotGbk", "[encoding]") {
    // Call the function
    std::vector<char> result = findShiftJisNotGbk();

    // Define expected results (this should match your Python unittest)
    std::vector<char> expected = {'\x80', '\x81', /* ... */}; // Replace with actual expected values

    // Check if the result matches the expected output
    REQUIRE(result == expected);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` line includes the Catch2 header file, which is necessary to use Catch2 for testing.
2. **Function Declaration**: The `std::vector<char> findShiftJisNotGbk();` line declares the function that needs to be tested.
3. **Test Case**: The `TEST_CASE("findShiftJisNotGbk", "[encoding]")` macro defines a new test case named "findShiftJisNotGbk". The `[encoding]` tag is optional but helps in organizing tests.
4. **Call Function**: Inside the test case, the `findShiftJisNotGbk()` function is called and its result is stored in the `result` vector.
5. **Expected Result**: The `expected` vector contains the expected output of the function. This should match the result you would get from your Python unittest.
6. **Assertion**: The `REQUIRE(result == expected);` line checks if the `result` vector matches the `expected` vector. If they do not match, the test will fail.

Make sure to replace the placeholder characters in the `expected` vector with the actual expected values based on your Python unittest.

This should give you a good starting point for converting your Python unittest to a C++ Catch2 test case.
