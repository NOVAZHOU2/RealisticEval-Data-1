Sure! Here is the C++ code signature for the provided Python function, keeping the same comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <regex>

/**
 * Extracts the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD from the given file name.
 *
 * @param file_name The name of the file which may contain a date.
 * @return The extracted date string in YYYY-MM-DD format if found, else an empty string.
 */
std::string extract_date_from_filename(const std::string& file_name);
```

This C++ function signature includes the necessary `#include` directives for handling strings and regular expressions. The function returns a `std::string` instead of `None`, as C++ does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `None`. An empty string will be returned if no date is found.
