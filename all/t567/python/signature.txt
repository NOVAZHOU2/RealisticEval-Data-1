To convert the provided TypeScript function signature into Python while preserving the code comments, we need to follow Python's syntax and conventions. Below is the equivalent Python code signature for the function getRelativeTime:
python
def get_relative_time(message_date: datetime) -> str:
    """
    Returns a string representing the relative time since the given message was created.

    - If the message was created today, it returns "Today".
    - If the message was created yesterday, it returns "Yesterday".
    - If the message was created within the past week (but not today or yesterday),
      it returns the corresponding day of the week (e.g., "Monday").
    - If the message was created earlier than one week ago, it returns a formatted date string
      (e.g., "YYYY/MM/DD").

    :param message_date: The date when the message was created. This should be a valid datetime object.
    :returns: A string indicating the relative time from the current date to the message creation date.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Key Changes Explained:
Function Name: Changed from getRelativeTime to get_relative_time to adhere to Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type: Changed messageDate: Date to message_date: datetime. In Python, the datetime module is commonly used to handle dates and times, and you will need to import it with from datetime import datetime.
Return Type: Changed : string to -> str, following Python's type hinting syntax.
Docstring Format: Converted JSDoc-style comments into a Python docstring using triple quotes """.
Comment Syntax: The comments remain the same but have been adapted for readability within the Python context.
This signature can be used as the starting point for implementing the function in Python. Make sure to import the necessary modules if you are going to use this function in a complete program.
