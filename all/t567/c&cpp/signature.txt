Here's the equivalent C++ code signature with comments, maintaining the original structure and meaning:

```cpp
/**
 * Returns a string representing the relative time since the given message was created.
 *
 * - If the message was created today, it returns "Today".
 * - If the message was created yesterday, it returns "Yesterday".
 * - If the message was created within the past week (but not today or yesterday),
 *   it returns the corresponding day of the week (e.g., "Monday").
 * - If the message was created earlier than one week ago, it returns a formatted date string
 *   (e.g., "YYYY/MM/DD").
 *
 * @param messageDate - The date when the message was created. This should be a valid time_point.
 * @returns A string indicating the relative time from the current date to the message creation date.
 */
std::string getRelativeTime(const std::chrono::system_clock::time_point& messageDate);
```

### Notes:
- The parameter type is changed to `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point` to match C++ date handling.
- The return type is `std::string`, which corresponds to the string return in TypeScript.
