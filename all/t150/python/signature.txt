Sure! Below are the Python code signatures that correspond to the provided TypeScript code, along with the original comments.
python
def rgb_to_hex(rgb: dict[str, int]) -> str:
    """ 
    Convert an RGB color object to a HEX color string. 
    :param rgb: An object containing the red, green, and blue components of the color. 
    :returns: A string representing the HEX color code. 
    """
    pass


def hex_to_rgb(hex: str) -> dict[str, int] | None:
    """ 
    Convert a HEX color string to an RGB color object. 
    :param hex: A string representing the HEX color code. 
    :returns: An object containing the red, green, and blue components of the color, or null if the HEX code is invalid. 
    """
    pass
Key Changes Explained:
Function Names: Changed from camelCase (rgbToHex, hexToRgb) to snake_case (rgb_to_hex, hex_to_rgb), which is the convention in Python.
Parameter Type Annotations: In TypeScript, object types are defined using a specific syntax. In Python, we typically use dict for dictionaries and specify the types of keys and values.
Return Type: In Python, the return type uses -> to specify the type, and | None indicates that the function can return either a dictionary or None.
Comments: The original comments were retained and formatted as docstrings, which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
