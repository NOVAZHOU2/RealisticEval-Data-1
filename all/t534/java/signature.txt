Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code signature for the given JavaScript function, including the comments:

```java
/**
 * Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from an array.
 *
 * @param array The array from which to remove the element.
 * @param element The element to remove from the array.
 * @return A new array with the element removed, or the original array if the element is not found.
 */
public static Object[] removeElementInArray(Object[] array, Object element) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`Object[]`**: This represents an array that can hold elements of any type (similar to `Array` in JavaScript).
- **`static`**: This means the method belongs to the class itself rather than any instance of the class.
- **`public`**: This means the method can be accessed from anywhere.
- **`removeElementInArray`**: The name of the method.
- **`Object[] array`**: The parameter representing the array from which the element will be removed.
- **`Object element`**: The parameter representing the element to be removed from the array.
- **`Object[]`**: The return type, indicating that the method returns a new array with the element removed.

This signature ensures that the method can handle arrays of any object type and returns a new array without modifying the original one.
