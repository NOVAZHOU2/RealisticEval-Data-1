Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to a Java method signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from an array.
 *
 * @param array   The array from which to remove the element.
 * @param element The element to remove from the array.
 * @return A new array with the element removed, or the original array if the element is not found.
 */
public static int[] removeElementInArray(int[] array, int element) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, arrays are passed by value, but the elements of the array are passed by reference. If you want to modify the original array, you would need to use a different approach, such as returning a new array as shown above.
