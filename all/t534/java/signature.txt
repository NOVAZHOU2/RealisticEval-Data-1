Here's the Java method signature with comments converted from your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a list.
 *
 * @param list - The list from which to remove the element.
 * @param element - The element to remove from the list.
 * @return A new list with the element removed, or the original list if the element is not found.
 */
public static <T> List<T> removeElementInArray(List<T> list, T element) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This signature reflects the Java type system while keeping the comments intact.
