Certainly! Below is the Python code signature equivalent to your JavaScript function, keeping the same comments:

```python
def remove_element_in_array(array, element):
    """
    Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from an array.

    :param array: The array from which to remove the element.
    :type array: list
    :param element: The element to remove from the array.
    :type element: Any
    :return: A new array with the element removed, or the original array if the element is not found.
    :rtype: list
    """
```

This Python function signature follows the same structure and includes type hints for clarity, similar to how JavaScript uses JSDoc comments.
