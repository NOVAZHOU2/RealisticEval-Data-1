To convert the JavaScript function signature with comments into a Python function signature along with a docstring, you can follow this structure:
python
def remove_element_in_array(array, element):
    """
    Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a list.

    Args:
        array (list): The list from which to remove the element.
        element: The element to remove from the list.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with the element removed, or the original list if the element is not found.
    """
    pass  # Implement the function logic here
Explanation:
The function name in Python is written in snake_case, which is the convention for naming functions.
The Args section describes the parameters, using list as the type for array since Python uses lists instead of arrays.
The Returns section describes the return type, which is also a list.
The pass statement is a placeholder for where the function logic would go.
This structure captures the same purpose and documentation as the original JavaScript code.
