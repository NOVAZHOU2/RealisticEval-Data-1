Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function that removes the first occurrence of a specified element from an array:
python
def remove_element_in_array(array, element):
    # Create a new list to avoid modifying the original
    new_array = []
    
    # A flag to check if the element has been removed
    removed = False
    
    # Iterate through the original array
    for item in array:
        if item != element:
            new_array.append(item)  # Add elements that are not the target element
        else:
            if not removed:
                removed = True  # Mark that we've removed the element
                continue  # Skip the first occurrence of the element
            
    # Return a new list that does not include the specified element
    return new_array

# Example usage:
original_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
element_to_remove = 2
result = remove_element_in_array(original_array, element_to_remove)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 2]
Explanation:
The function remove_element_in_array takes an array and an element as input.
It creates a new list called new_array to store elements that are not the specified element.
The loop iterates through each item in the original array. If an item is equal to the specified element and it hasn't been removed yet, it will skip adding it to new_array on the first occurrence. Subsequent occurrences will be added.
Finally, it returns new_array, which contains the original elements except for the first occurrence of the specified element.
