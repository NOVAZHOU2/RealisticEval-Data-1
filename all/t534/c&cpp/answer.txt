Here's the equivalent C++ code for your JavaScript function:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

/**
 * Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a vector.
 *
 * @param array - The vector from which to remove the element.
 * @param element - The element to remove from the vector.
 * @return A new vector with the element removed, or the original vector if the element is not found.
 */
std::vector<int> removeElementInVector(std::vector<int>& array, int element) {
    auto it = std::find(array.begin(), array.end(), element);
    
    if (it != array.end()) {
        array.erase(it);
    }
    
    return array;
}
```

This C++ function uses the `std::find` algorithm to locate the first occurrence of the specified element in the vector. If the element is found, it is erased using the `erase` method. The modified vector is then returned.

Please note that in C++, we typically use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays for dynamic collections. Also, the return type of the function should be `std::vector<int>` assuming the elements of the input vector are integers. Adjust the return type and parameter types accordingly based on your actual needs.
