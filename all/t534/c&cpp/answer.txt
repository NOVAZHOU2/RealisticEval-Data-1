Sure, here's how you can translate that JavaScript function into C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

/**
 * Removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a vector.
 *
 * @param vec - The vector from which to remove the element.
 * @param element - The element to remove from the vector.
 * @return A new vector with the element removed, or the original vector if the element is not found.
 */
std::vector<int> removeElementInVector(std::vector<int>& vec, int element) {
    auto it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), element);
    
    if (it != vec.end()) {
        vec.erase(it);
    }

    return vec;
}
```

This function uses the `std::find` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header to locate the first occurrence of the element in the vector. If the element is found, it uses the `erase` method to remove it. The modified vector is then returned.

Please note that the return type of the function is `std::vector<int>`, assuming the elements in your vector are integers. If you have another data type for your elements, replace `int` accordingly.
