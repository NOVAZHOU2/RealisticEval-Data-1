Here is the equivalent TypeScript function signature:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert the question in RDF JSON-LD format to NGSI-LD format
 * 
 * @param {string} rdfJsonLd - RDF JSON-LD formatted question as a string.
 * @returns {any} Data formatted according to NGSI-LD specifications.
 */
function rdfJsonLdToNgsiLD(rdfJsonLd: string): any {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

Note that in TypeScript, there isn't a direct equivalent to Python's `Dict` type, so I've used `any` instead. If you know more about the structure of the data being returned, you could replace `any` with a more specific type.
