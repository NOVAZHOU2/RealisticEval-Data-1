Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert the question in RDF JSON-LD format to NGSI-LD format
 * @param {string} rdfJsonLd - RDF JSON-LD formatted question as a string.
 * @returns {Object} Data formatted according to NGSI-LD specifications.
 */
function rdfJsonLdToNgsiLd(rdfJsonLd) {
```

Please note that in JavaScript, there's no need for explicit type declarations like in Python with `typing`. Instead, we use JSDoc comments to describe the types and purpose of parameters and return values.
