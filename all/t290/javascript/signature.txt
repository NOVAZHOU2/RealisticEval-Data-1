Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts the input in RDF JSON-LD format to NGSI-LD format.
 * 
 * @param {string} rdfJsonLd - The RDF JSON-LD formatted input as a string.
 * 
 * @returns {Object} Data formatted according to NGSI-LD specifications.
 */
function rdfJsonLdToNgSiLd(rdfJsonLd) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

In this conversion, I've renamed `rdf_jsonld` to `rdfJsonLd` to follow the camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript. Similarly, the function name `rdf_jsonld_to_ngsild` has been changed to `rdfJsonLdToNgSiLd` for consistency. The return type hint `Dict` in Python is translated to `{Object}` in JavaScript since plain objects are typically used to represent structured data in JS.
