Sure, here's how you might translate that Python function into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert the question in RDF JSON-LD format to NGSI-LD format
 *
 * @param {string} rdfJsonld - RDF JSON-LD formatted question as a string.
 * @return {Object} Data formatted according to NGSI-LD specifications.
 */
function rdfJsonLdToNgsiLd(rdfJsonld) {
    // Your conversion logic goes here...
}
```

Please note that JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent of Python's `typing` module for type annotations. The comments above serve the same purpose and should be used to document the function parameters and return value. The actual conversion logic would depend on your specific requirements and the structure of the data you're working with.
