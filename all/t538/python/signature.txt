To convert the given JavaScript code signature into a Python code signature, we need to adjust the syntax and conventions to fit Python's style. Below is the equivalent Python function signature with a docstring that matches the original JavaScript comments:
python
def sort_by_field(array, field: str, ascending: bool = True) -> list:
    """
    Sorts a list of dictionaries alphabetically based on a specified field.

    :param array: List of dictionaries to sort.
    :param field: The field of the dictionaries to sort by.
    :param ascending: If True, sort in ascending order; if False, sort in descending order.
    :return: The sorted list of dictionaries.
    """
    pass  # Implement sorting logic here
Explanation:
Function Name: Changed from sortByField to sort_by_field to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameters:
array: The input list of objects (dictionaries in Python).
field: A string that specifies the key in the dictionaries to sort by.
ascending: A boolean that indicates the sort order, defaulting to True for ascending order.
Return Type: Specified as -> list to indicate that the function will return a list.
Docstring: Rewritten to use Python's docstring format with proper parameter and return descriptions.
Implementation Placeholder: Added a pass statement for the function body, indicating where the sorting logic should be implemented.
