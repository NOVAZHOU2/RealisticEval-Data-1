Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments that match the original JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Sorts an array of objects alphabetically based on a specified field.
 *
 * @param array - A vector of objects to sort.
 * @param field - The name of the field of the objects to sort by.
 * @param ascending - A boolean indicating whether to sort in ascending (true) or descending (false) order.
 * @return A sorted vector of objects.
 */
std::vector<MyObject> sortByField(const std::vector<MyObject>& array, const std::string& field, bool ascending = true);
```

In this C++ version:
- `array` is represented by a `const std::vector<MyObject>&`, assuming `MyObject` is the type of object in the array.
- `field` is a `const std::string&` representing the name of the field to sort by.
- `ascending` is a `bool` parameter with a default value of `true`.
- The return type is `std::vector<MyObject>` which represents the sorted array of objects.

Make sure to replace `MyObject` with the actual type of your objects and adjust any necessary includes or namespaces accordingly.
