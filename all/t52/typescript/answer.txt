Here is how you can convert your Python function to TypeScript:

```typescript
function renameFilePath(path: string): string {
    /**
     * Renames a Windows file path by replacing colons in the filename with underscores.
     *
     * @param {string} path - The original file path.
     * @returns {string} - The modified file path with colons in the filename replaced by underscores.
     */
    return path.replace(/\\/g, '_');
}
```

In this TypeScript version of your function, I'm using JavaScript's `replace()` method with a regular expression (`/\\/g`) that matches all backslashes (`\\`), and replaces them with underscores (`_`). This should give you the same functionality as your original Python function.
