Sure, here is the Java code signature equivalent to your Python function, keeping the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Renames a Windows file path by replacing colons in the filename with underscores.
 *
 * @param path The original file path.
 * @return The modified file path with colons in the filename replaced by underscores.
 */
public static String renameFilePath(String path) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method `renameFilePath` takes a string parameter `path` and returns a string. The docstring (Java's equivalent of Python's comments above functions) describes what the method does, its parameters, and its return value.
