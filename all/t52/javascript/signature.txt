Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Renames a Windows file path by replacing colons in the filename with underscores.
 *
 * @param {string} path - The original file path.
 * @returns {string} - The modified file path with colons in the filename replaced by underscores.
 */
function renameFilePath(path) {
    return path.replace(/\\/g, '_');
}
```

Please note that the regular expression `/\\/g` is used to replace all occurrences of backslashes (`\`) with underscores (`_`). This is because backslashes are special characters in regular expressions and need to be escaped with another backslash in JavaScript strings. Also, the `g` flag at the end means "global", so it will replace all instances throughout the string, not just the first one.
