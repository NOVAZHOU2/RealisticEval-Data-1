Sure, here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Renames a Windows file path by replacing colons in the filename with underscores.
 *
 * @param {string} path - The original file path.
 * @returns {string} - The modified file path with colons in the filename replaced by underscores.
 */
function renameFilePath(path) {
    return path.replace(/\\/g, '_');
}
```

This function uses the `replace` method with a regular expression to replace all backslashes (`\\`) in the input string with underscores (`_`). This should serve the same purpose as your Python function for renaming file paths on Windows.
