Here’s the equivalent Python code for your TypeScript function that converts an array of boolean values to a binary string representation:
python
def bool_array_to_binary_string(bool_array):
    """
    Converts the array of Boolean values to a binary string representation,
    which converts to the character '1' if the Boolean value is true.
    Otherwise, it is converted to the character '0', and the final string is returned.

    Args:
        bool_array (list[bool]): An array of boolean values.

    Returns:
        str: A binary string where '1' represents true and '0' represents false.
    """
    return ''.join('1' if bool_val else '0' for bool_val in bool_array)

# Example usage
bool_array = [True, False, True, False]
binary_string = bool_array_to_binary_string(bool_array)
print(binary_string)  # Output: "1010"
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition:
The function name follows Python’s naming conventions, changing from camelCase to snake_case.
Docstring:
The comments from TypeScript are converted into a Python docstring format, providing details about the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
Boolean Array Conversion:
The map function from TypeScript is replaced with a generator expression in Python. This expression iterates over bool_array and generates '1' for True values and '0' for False values.
join() is called on the resulting generator to concatenate the characters into a single string.
Example Usage:
An example usage of the function is included to demonstrate how it works.
You can use this function in your Python code as needed! Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!
