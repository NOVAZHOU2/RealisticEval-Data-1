Hereâ€™s how to convert the TypeScript function signature to a Python function signature while keeping the comments intact. The Python version will utilize type hints for clarity, as well as maintain the original comments.
python
def bool_array_to_binary_string(bool_array: list[bool]) -> str:
    """
    Converts the array of Boolean values to a binary string representation,
    which converts to the character '1' if the Boolean value is true.
    Otherwise, it is converted to the character '0', and the final string is returned.

    Args:
        bool_array (list[bool]): An array of boolean values.

    Returns:
        str: A binary string where '1' represents true and '0' represents false.
    """
    # @ts-ignore
    pass  # Replace with implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
Changed from boolArrayToBinaryString (camelCase) to bool_array_to_binary_string (snake_case) to follow Python's naming conventions.
Type Hints:
The parameter bool_array is annotated with list[bool], indicating that it is a list of boolean values.
The return type is indicated with -> str, showing that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
The comments from TypeScript are converted into a Python docstring, formatted to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.
Placeholder Implementation:
The function body includes a pass statement, indicating that it is a placeholder until you add the actual implementation.
TypeScript Ignore Comment:
The // @ts-ignore comment is included as a regular comment (#) to maintain the original context, though it's not necessary in Python.
You can now implement the function logic where the pass statement is placed. Let me know if you need further assistance!
