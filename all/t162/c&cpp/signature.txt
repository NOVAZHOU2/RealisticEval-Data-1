Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments preserved:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Converts the array of Boolean values to a binary string representation, 
 * which converts to the character '1' if the Boolean value is true. 
 * Otherwise, it is converted to the character '0', and the final string is returned.
 *
 * @param boolArray An array of boolean values.
 * @returns A binary string where '1' represents true and '0' represents false.
 */
std::string boolArrayToBinaryString(const std::vector<bool>& boolArray) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The comments from the TypeScript version are included.
- The parameter type is changed to `const std::vector<bool>&` to match C++ conventions.
- The return type is specified as `std::string`.
