Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments retained, converted from the TypeScript signature you provided:

```java
/**
 * Converts the array of Boolean values to a binary string representation,
 * which converts to the character '1' if the Boolean value is true.
 * Otherwise, it is converted to the character '0', and the final string is returned.
 *
 * @param boolArray An array of boolean values.
 * @return A binary string where '1' represents true and '0' represents false.
 */
public static String boolArrayToBinaryString(boolean[] boolArray) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The function is declared as `public static` to reflect typical Java conventions for utility methods.
- The parameter type is `boolean[]`, and the return type is `String`, consistent with Java syntax.
