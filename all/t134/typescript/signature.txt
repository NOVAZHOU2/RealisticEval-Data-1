Here's the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Checks whether the provided username is valid.
 * A valid username is defined as a string that:
 * - Has a length between 5 and 16 characters (inclusive).
 * - Contains only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) and spaces.
 *
 * @param {string} username - The username to validate.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the username is valid; otherwise, false.
 */
function isValidUsername(username: string): boolean {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This retains the original comments and adds the appropriate TypeScript type annotations for the parameter and return type.
