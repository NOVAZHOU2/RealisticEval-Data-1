To convert the given Java function signature to a Python function signature, we need to consider a few differences between Java and Python syntax. Here's how you can translate the provided Java function into Python:
Java Function Signature:
java
/** 
 * Performs binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target value. 
 * 
 * @param array the sorted array to search 
 * @param target the value to search for 
 * @return the index of the target value if found, otherwise -1 
 */
public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {}
Python Function Signature:
In Python, we don't need to specify types for parameters or return values explicitly like in Java, but we can use type hints to indicate the types of parameters and the return type.
Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python function signature:
python
def binary_search(array: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    pass
Explanation:
Function Name: The Java function name binarySearch is changed to binary_search to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
Parameter Types:
int[] array in Java translates to list[int] in Python, indicating that array is a list of integers.
int target in Java becomes target: int in Python, indicating that target is an integer.
Return Type: The return type int in Java is represented as -> int in Python, indicating that the function returns an integer.
Full Function Definition:
Here is how you would define the complete binary search function in Python, including the algorithm (if you want to implement it):
python
def binary_search(array: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # To avoid overflow
        
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    
    return -1  # Target not found
Key Points:
The pass statement is used when you define a function without implementation. You can replace it with the actual algorithm later.
Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces {} used in Java.
The while loop and conditional statements are also similar but follow Python syntax.
