Here's the equivalent Python function signature for the provided Java function signature. This includes the necessary docstring to describe the function's purpose and parameters, along with the method's return type:
python
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def convert(html: str) -> str:
        """
        Converts a string containing HTML to a Markdown-formatted string.

        1. Line breaks (<br> or <br/>): Replaced with newline characters.
        2. Paragraphs (<p> and </p>): Opening <p> tags are removed, while closing
           </p> tags are replaced with two newline characters to separate paragraphs.
        3. Strong emphasis (<strong> and </strong>): Replaced with double asterisks (**).
        4. Italics (<em> and </em>): Replaced with single asterisks (*).
        5. Underlined text (<u> and </u>): Replaced with single asterisks (*)
           as underlining is not supported in Markdown.
        6. Code snippets (<code> and </code>): Replaced with backticks (`).
        7. Unordered lists (<ul> and </ul>): Opening and closing tags are removed.
        8. Ordered lists (<ol> and </ol>): Opening and closing tags are removed.
        9. List items (<li>): Opening <li> tags are replaced with an asterisk followed
           by a space, while closing </li> tags are replaced with a newline character.
        10. Hyperlinks (<a href="...">...</a>): Replaced with the Markdown format
            [text](URL), where "text" is the anchor text and "URL" is the link target.

        Args:
            html (str): The input string containing HTML content.

        Returns:
            str: A string formatted in Markdown, reflecting the input HTML structure.
        """
        # Function implementation will go here
        pass  # Replace this with the actual implementation
Explanation of the Python Signature:
Class and Static Method: The convert method is defined inside the Answer class as a static method, similar to the Java implementation.
Function Parameters:
The parameter html is typed as str, indicating it expects a string input.
Return Type: The function is annotated with -> str, indicating it will return a string.
Docstring:
The docstring explains what the function does, listing its behavior and specifying the input parameter and return value.
The format adheres to Python's conventions for documenting methods, including the Args and Returns sections.
Implementation Placeholder: The pass statement indicates that the function's implementation should go here. You can replace it with the actual conversion logic as needed.
