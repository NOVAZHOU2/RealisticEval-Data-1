Below is the C++ Catch2 test cases translated into Python using the unittest framework. Each test case is structured to match the original purpose while adhering to Python's conventions.
python
import unittest

# Assuming get_days_in_month is defined elsewhere in your code
from your_module import get_days_in_month, InvalidMonthError 

class Tester(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_leap_year_february(self):
        """Test for leap year February."""
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2024, 2), 29)  # 2024 is a leap year

    def test_non_leap_year_february(self):
        """Test for non-leap year February."""
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2023, 2), 28)  # 2023 is not a leap year

    def test_month_with_31_days(self):
        """Test for months with 31 days."""
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2023, 1), 31)  # January has 31 days
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2023, 7), 31)  # July has 31 days

    def test_month_with_30_days(self):
        """Test for months with 30 days."""
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2023, 4), 30)  # April has 30 days
        self.assertEqual(get_days_in_month(2023, 11), 30) # November has 30 days

    def test_invalid_month(self):
        """Test for invalid months."""
        with self.assertRaises(InvalidMonthError):
            get_days_in_month(2023, 0)  # Month less than 1
        with self.assertRaises(InvalidMonthError):
            get_days_in_month(2023, 13)  # Month greater than 12

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation:
Imports:
unittest: The built-in Python testing framework.
Assuming that get_days_in_month and InvalidMonthError are defined in a module named your_module, replace your_module with the actual module name.
Class Definition:
The class Tester inherits from unittest.TestCase, allowing the use of built-in assertion methods.
Test Methods:
Each method corresponds to a test case in the original C++ code, prefixed with test_ to ensure that unittest recognizes them as test cases.
Assertions are made using self.assertEqual() to check expected values and self.assertRaises() to check for exceptions.
Docstrings:
Each test method includes a docstring that describes what is being tested, similar to the comments in the original C++ tests.
Execution:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the tests run when the script is executed directly.
This Python code will perform the same tests as the original C++ code, ensuring the functionality of the get_days_in_month function under various conditions.
