Here's the C++ code signature you provided converted into Python code, with the comments translated into Python style:
python
def get_days_in_month(year: int, month: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of days in a given month of a specific year.

    This function accounts for leap years when calculating the number of days in February.

    Args:
        year (int): The year for which to get the number of days in the month. This should be
                     a valid integer representing a year (e.g., 2024).
        month (int): The month for which to get the number of days. It should be an integer
                      between 1 and 12, where 1 corresponds to January and 12 to December.

    Returns:
        int: The number of days in the specified month of the specified year.
    """
    pass
Changes Made:
The function name has been changed from getDaysInMonth (C++) to get_days_in_month (Python), following the Python naming convention (PEP 8).
The argument types and return type are specified using Python type hints (year: int, month: int, -> int).
The comment format has been changed to a Python docstring format (triple quotes).
The stdexcept include and empty function body ({ }) are removed and replaced with pass, which is a placeholder in Python.
