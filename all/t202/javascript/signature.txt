Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature along with the comments converted to JavaScript style:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Returns the number of days in a given month of a specific year.
 *
 * This function accounts for leap years when calculating the number of days in February.
 *
 * @param {number} year - The year for which to get the number of days in the month.
 * @param {number} month - The month for which to get the number of days (1-12).
 * @return {number} The number of days in the specified month of the specified year.
 */
function getDaysInMonth(year, month) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this translation:
- The C++ `int` type is replaced with JavaScript's `number` type.
- The function syntax is adapted from C++ to JavaScript.
- The comments are reformatted to use JavaScript's `//` for single-line comments and `/** ... */` for multi-line comments.
