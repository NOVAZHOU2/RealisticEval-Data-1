Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method signature, including the appropriate comments in Javadoc format. The conversion maintains the original functionality and structure while following Java conventions.

```java
/**
 * @brief Returns the number of days in a given month of a specific year.
 *
 * This function accounts for leap years when calculating the number of days in February.
 *
 * @param year The year for which to get the number of days in the month. This should be
 *             a valid integer representing a year (e.g., 2024).
 * @param month The month for which to get the number of days. It should be an integer
 *              between 1 and 12, where 1 corresponds to January and 12 to December.
 * @return The number of days in the specified month of the specified year.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the month is not between 1 and 12.
 */
public static int getDaysInMonth(int year, int month) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Points in the Conversion:
- **Method Signature**: The C++ function is translated into a `public static int` method in Java.
- **Javadoc Comments**: The comments are converted into Javadoc format, retaining the structure and detail of the original C++ documentation.
- **Exception Handling**: An appropriate mention of the exception (`IllegalArgumentException`) is included in the comments. 

This conversion provides a clear and precise Java equivalent of the original C++ function signature and documentation.
