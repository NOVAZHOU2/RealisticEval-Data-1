Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @return The formatted time string.
 */
public String getTime() {
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same structure and includes the Javadoc comment that describes what the method does and returns.
