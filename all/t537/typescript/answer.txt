Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function:

```typescript
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted time string.
 */
function getTime(): string {
    const now = new Date();
    let hours: number = now.getHours();
    let minutes: number = now.getMinutes();
    let ampm: string = hours >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';

    // Convert hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format
    hours = hours % 12;
    hours = hours ? hours : 12; // If hours is 0, it should be 12

    // Ensure minutes are always two digits
    minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : minutes;

    return `${hours}:${minutes} ${ampm}`;
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The function `getTime` now explicitly returns a `string`.
- The variables `hours`, `minutes`, and `ampm` are typed with their respective data types (`number` for `hours` and `minutes`, and `string` for `ampm`).
