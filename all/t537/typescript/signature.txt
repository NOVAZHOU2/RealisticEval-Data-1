To change the function signature to TypeScript while keeping the comments, you can add a return type to the function. Hereâ€™s how it looks:

```typescript
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted time string.
 */
function getTime(): string {
}
```

This specifies that the function `getTime` returns a string. If you need further modifications or explanations, let me know!
