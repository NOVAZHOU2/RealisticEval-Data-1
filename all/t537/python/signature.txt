Sure! Here is the Python version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```python
def get_time():
    """
    Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.

    :return: The formatted time string.
    :rtype: str
    """
```

This Python function uses a docstring (similar to the JavaScript comment) to describe what the function does and its return type.
