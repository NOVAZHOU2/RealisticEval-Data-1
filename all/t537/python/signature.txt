To convert the JavaScript function signature and documentation into a Python function signature, you'll typically use Python's docstring conventions to describe the function's purpose and its return type. Below is the equivalent Python code signature based on your JavaScript example.
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted time string.
 */
function getTime() {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def get_time() -> str:
    """
    Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted time string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation
Function Definition:
def get_time() -> str: defines a function named get_time that is expected to return a string.
Docstring:
The triple quotes """ are used for the docstring, which describes the function's purpose and specifies that it returns a string.
The section under Returns: clearly states the return type as str.
Placeholder Implementation:
pass is used as a placeholder in Python, indicating that the function does not perform any actions yet.
Usage
You can implement the function later by replacing the pass statement with the actual code to retrieve and format the current time. Hereâ€™s how you can eventually implement it:
python
from datetime import datetime

def get_time() -> str:
    """
    Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted time string.
    """
    current_date = datetime.now()
    formatted_time = current_date.strftime('%I:%M %p')
    return formatted_time
This conversion captures the essence of the original JavaScript function in a Pythonic manner.
