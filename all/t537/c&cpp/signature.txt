Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @return std::string The formatted time string.
 */
std::string getTime();
```

This function declaration in C++ specifies that `getTime` returns a `std::string` and does not take any parameters. The comment above it describes what the function does.
