Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code with the same function signature and comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current time formatted as 'hh:mm AM/PM'.
 *
 * @return std::string The formatted time string.
 */
std::string getTime();
```

This C++ code declares a function named `getTime` that returns a `std::string`. The comment above the function describes its purpose.
