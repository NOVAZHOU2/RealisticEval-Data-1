Here is your Python code translated into JavaScript:

```javascript
class BloomFilter {
    /**
     * Implement a bloom filter class with an add method that adds an element to the Bloom filter.
     * Callers can check for the presence of an element directly using the 'includes' method.
     */

    constructor(size, hashCount) {
        // Initialize the Bloom Filter
    }

    add(item) {
        // Add an item to the Bloom Filter
    }
}
```

Note: The `in` operator in Python is equivalent to the `includes` method in JavaScript when checking for the existence of an item in a collection. However, it's worth noting that these methods operate differently when used on different types of objects. In Python, `in` checks if a value exists within a dictionary or list, while in JavaScript, `includes` checks if an array contains a specific value. If you're working with arrays in JavaScript, use `includes`, otherwise, you may need to implement a similar functionality yourself.
