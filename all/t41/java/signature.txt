Certainly! Here is the equivalent Java code for the given Python class, including appropriate Javadoc comments and method signatures:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Implements a Bloom filter class with an add method that adds an element to the Bloom filter.
 * Callers can check for the presence of an element directly.
 */
public class BloomFilter {

    /**
     * Constructs a Bloom filter with the specified size and number of hash functions.
     *
     * @param size       the size of the Bloom filter
     * @param hashCount  the number of hash functions to use
     */
    public BloomFilter(int size, int hashCount) {
        // Constructor implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Adds an item to the Bloom filter.
     *
     * @param item the item to add
     */
    public void add(String item) {
        // Add an item to the Bloom filter
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Checks if an item is possibly present in the Bloom filter.
     *
     * @param item the item to check
     * @return true if the item might be present, false otherwise
     */
    public boolean contains(String item) {
        // Check if the item is possibly present in the Bloom filter
        // Implementation goes here
        return false; // Placeholder return statement
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BloomFilter bloomFilter = new BloomFilter(1000, 5);
        bloomFilter.add("example");
        System.out.println(bloomFilter.contains("example")); // Expected: true
        System.out.println(bloomFilter.contains("not_in_filter")); // Expected: false
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The `BloomFilter` class is defined with appropriate Javadoc comments describing its purpose.
2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor `BloomFilter(int size, int hashCount)` is defined with Javadoc comments explaining its parameters.
   - The constructor body is left empty for now, but it can be filled with the necessary initialization logic.
3. **Add Method**:
   - The `add` method is defined with Javadoc comments explaining its parameter.
   - The method body is left empty for now, but it can be filled with the necessary logic to add an item to the Bloom filter.
4. **Contains Method**:
   - The `contains` method is defined with Javadoc comments explaining its parameter and return value.
   - The method body is left empty for now, but it can be filled with the necessary logic to check if an item is possibly present in the Bloom filter.
5. **Main Method**: An example usage of the `BloomFilter` class is provided in the `main` method.

This Java code preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to Java's conventions and providing clear documentation through Javadoc comments.
