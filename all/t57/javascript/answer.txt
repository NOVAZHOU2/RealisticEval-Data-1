Sure! To convert the given Python code into JavaScript, we need to use a library that can handle image manipulation similar to how `PIL` does in Python. One such library for JavaScript is `sharp`, which is a high-performance image processing library. However, since `sharp` doesn't directly support saving images in ICO format, we'll use another library called `iconv` to handle the conversion to ICO format.

Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install sharp iconv
   ```

2. The JavaScript code:

```javascript
const sharp = require('sharp');
const iconv = require('iconv');

/**
 * Convert a PNG image file to an ICO format file.
 *
 * @param {string} pngFilePath - Path to the source PNG image file.
 * @param {string} icoFilePath - Path to save the ICO file.
 * @param {Array} iconSizes - Array of tuples specifying the sizes to include in the ICO file.
 */
async function convertPngToIco(pngFilePath, icoFilePath, iconSizes = [[32, 32]]) {
    try {
        // Load the PNG image using sharp
        const img = await sharp(pngFilePath);

        // Resize the image to the specified sizes
        const resizedImages = iconSizes.map(size => img.resize(size[0], size[1]));

        // Convert the resized images to ICO format
        const icoBuffer = await Promise.all(resizedImages).then(images => {
            return iconv.toIco(images);
        });

        // Save the ICO file
        await sharp(icoBuffer).toFile(icoFilePath);

        console.log(`ICO file saved at ${icoFilePath}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error converting PNG to ICO:', error);
    }
}

// Example usage
convertPngToIco('path/to/input.png', 'path/to/output.ico', [[32, 32]]);
```

### Notes:
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have installed `sharp` and `iconv`.
2. **Icon Conversion**: The `iconv.toIco` method is hypothetical and needs to be implemented or replaced with a suitable library or function that can handle the conversion to ICO format.
3. **Async/Await**: The JavaScript code uses async/await to handle asynchronous operations like loading and saving files.

If you don't find a suitable ICO conversion library, you might need to implement a custom solution or use a different library that supports ICO conversion.
