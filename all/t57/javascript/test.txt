To convert the given Python unittest test class to a Jest test case in JavaScript, you need to first define the function `convert_png_to_ico` and then write a Jest test for it. Here's how you can do it:

### Python Function Definition
```python
def convert_png_to_ico(png_file_path, ico_file_path, icon_sizes=[(32, 32)]):
    """
    Convert PNG images to ICO files
    Args:
        png_file_path (str): Path to the source PNG image file.
        ico_file_path (str): Path to save the ICO file.
        icon_sizes (list): List of tuples specifying the sizes to include in the ICO file.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Placeholder implementation
    pass
```

### Jest Test Case
Assuming you have a Node.js environment with Jest installed, here is how you can write the Jest test case:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Jest installed in your project. If not, install it using npm or yarn:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```

2. **Create the Test File**: Create a new file named `convertPngToIco.test.js`.

3. **Write the Test Case**:
   ```javascript
   const { convert_png_to_ico } = require('./path-to-your-function'); // Adjust the path accordingly

   describe('convert_png_to_ico', () => {
     test('should convert PNG to ICO with default size', async () => {
       const pngFilePath = 'path/to/source.png';
       const icoFilePath = 'path/to/output.ico';

       await convert_png_to_ico(pngFilePath, icoFilePath);

       // Assuming there's a way to check if the ICO file was created successfully
       expect(fs.existsSync(icoFilePath)).toBe(true);
     });

     test('should convert PNG to ICO with custom sizes', async () => {
       const pngFilePath = 'path/to/source.png';
       const icoFilePath = 'path/to/output.ico';
       const iconSizes = [(32, 32), (64, 64)];

       await convert_png_to_ico(pngFilePath, icoFilePath, iconSizes);

       // Assuming there's a way to check if the ICO file was created successfully
       expect(fs.existsSync(icoFilePath)).toBe(true);
     });
   });
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the function `convert_png_to_ico` is properly implemented and exported from the module.
- Replace `'./path-to-your-function'` with the actual path to your Python function.
- The test cases assume that there's a way to verify if the ICO file was created successfully. You might need to adjust this part based on how you plan to check the existence or contents of the output file.

This setup will help you write and run Jest tests for your Python function converted into a JavaScript function.
