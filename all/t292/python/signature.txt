Sure! Here is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same comments:

```python
def calculate_remaining_payment(principal: float, interest_rate: float, number_of_payments: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.

    :param principal: The initial amount of the debt.
    :type principal: float
    :param interest_rate: The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
    :type interest_rate: float
    :param number_of_payments: The total number of payments.
    :type number_of_payments: int
    :return: The calculated remaining payment.
    :rtype: float
    """
```

This Python function has the same parameters and return type as the original JavaScript function, along with the same docstring comments.
