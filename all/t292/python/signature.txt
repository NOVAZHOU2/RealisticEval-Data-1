To convert the given JavaScript function signature into Python, you will adjust the syntax to fit Python's conventions, including the use of type hints for parameter and return types. Below is the equivalent Python code signature:
python
def calculate_remaining_payment(principal: float, interest_rate: float, number_of_payments: int) -> float:
    pass
Explanation:
Function Name: In Python, it's common to use snake_case for function names, so calculateRemainingPayment becomes calculate_remaining_payment.
Parameters:
principal: The type is specified as float to indicate it represents a numerical value (the initial debt).
interestRate: This is changed to interest_rate for consistency with Python naming conventions, also with type float.
numberOfPayments: Similarly, changed to number_of_payments with type int.
Return Type: The return type is specified as float, indicating the function will return a numerical value.
You can now implement the function's logic inside this function signature. If you need help with that implementation, feel free to ask!
