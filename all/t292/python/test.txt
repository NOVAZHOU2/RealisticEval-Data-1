Sure! Below is the equivalent Python unit test case using the `unittest` framework for the JavaScript function `calculateRemainingPayment`.

```python
import unittest

def calculate_remaining_payment(principal, interest_rate, number_of_payments):
    # Implement your function logic here
    pass  # Replace with actual implementation

class TestCalculateRemainingPayment(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_calculate_remaining_payment(self):
        # Test data points
        test_cases = [
            (1000, 0.05, 12, 867.54),  # Example test case
            (5000, 0.03, 24, 3996.56),  # Another example test case
            # Add more test cases as needed
        ]

        for i, (principal, interest_rate, number_of_payments, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
            with self.subTest(case=i+1):
                result = calculate_remaining_payment(principal, interest_rate, number_of_payments)
                self.assertAlmostEqual(result, expected, places=2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_remaining_payment` function is defined but left empty. You need to implement the logic inside it.
2. **Test Class**: A test class `TestCalculateRemainingPayment` is created that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
3. **Test Method**: The `test_calculate_remaining_payment` method contains several test cases. Each test case is represented as a tuple `(principal, interest_rate, number_of_payments, expected)`.
4. **SubTest**: The `with self.subTest(case=i+1):` block ensures that each test case runs independently and provides a clear message if any one test fails.
5. **Assertion**: The `self.assertAlmostEqual` method checks if the result is approximately equal to the expected value, allowing for a small margin of error due to floating-point arithmetic.

Make sure to replace the placeholder logic inside `calculate_remaining_payment` with the actual implementation of your function.
