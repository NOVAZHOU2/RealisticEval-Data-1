Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function that calculates the remaining payment for a loan based on the principal, monthly interest rate, and total number of payments:
python
def calculate_remaining_payment(principal: float, interest_rate: float, number_of_payments: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.

    Args:
        principal (float): The initial amount of the debt.
        interest_rate (float): The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
        number_of_payments (int): The total number of payments.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated remaining payment.
    """
    # Calculate the fixed monthly payment using the amortization formula
    monthly_payment = principal * (interest_rate * (1 + interest_rate) ** number_of_payments) / \
                      ((1 + interest_rate) ** number_of_payments - 1)

    # Calculate the remaining balance after all payments (assuming all payments are made)
    balance = principal
    for _ in range(number_of_payments):
        balance = balance * (1 + interest_rate) - monthly_payment

    # Remaining balance after the payments
    return balance
Explanation of the Code:
Function Definition:
The function calculate_remaining_payment is defined with three parameters: principal, interest_rate, and number_of_payments.
Type hints are provided for better clarity and type checking.
Docstring:
A docstring describes the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
Monthly Payment Calculation:
The fixed monthly payment is calculated using the amortization formula. The formula is the same as in the JavaScript version but uses Python's exponentiation operator **.
Remaining Balance Calculation:
A loop iterates over the total number of payments, updating the balance after each payment.
Return Statement:
The function returns the remaining balance after all payments.
Usage Example
You can use this function in your Python code like this:
python
# Example usage
principal = 100000  # Initial loan amount
interest_rate = 0.05 / 12  # Monthly interest rate (5% annual rate)
number_of_payments = 60  # Total payments (5 years)

remaining_payment = calculate_remaining_payment(principal, interest_rate, number_of_payments)
print(f"Remaining payment: {remaining_payment:.2f}")
This example assumes a loan amount of $100,000 with a 5% annual interest rate, paid over 60 months (5 years). The output will show the remaining payment after all scheduled payments are made.
