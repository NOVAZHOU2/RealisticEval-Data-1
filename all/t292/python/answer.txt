Sure! Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function:

```python
def calculate_remaining_payment(principal: float, interest_rate: float, number_of_payments: int) -> float:
    # Placeholder return value; replace with actual calculation logic
    return 0.0
```

In Python, you would need to implement the actual calculation logic inside the `calculate_remaining_payment` function based on your specific requirements. If you have any additional details or a formula in mind, please provide them so I can assist further.
