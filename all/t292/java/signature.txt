Sure, here is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @return The calculated remaining payment.
 */
public double calculateRemainingPayment(double principal, double interestRate, int numberOfPayments) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, method signatures include the return type (`double` in this case), followed by the method name (`calculateRemainingPayment`), and then the parameters within parentheses. The comments remain the same.
