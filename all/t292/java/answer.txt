Here is how you can convert your JavaScript function into Java:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param principal The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param interestRate The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param numberOfPayments The total number of payments.
 * @return The calculated remaining payment.
 */
public double calculateRemainingPayment(double principal, double interestRate, int numberOfPayments) {
    // Your logic here...
}
```

In Java, functions are defined within classes, so you would need to create a class to contain this method. Also, unlike JavaScript where all numbers are floating-point (double in Java), you should specify whether each parameter is an integer or a double.

Remember to implement the actual logic inside the function body! This is just the signature of the function that calculates the remaining payment for a loan.
