Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code for the JavaScript function `calculateRemainingPayment`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @return The calculated remaining payment.
 */
double calculateRemainingPayment(double principal, double interestRate, int numberOfPayments) {
    if (interestRate == 0 || numberOfPayments == 0) {
        return principal;
    }

    double monthlyPayment = (principal * interestRate) / (1 - pow(1 + interestRate, -numberOfPayments));
    double remainingPayment = principal;

    for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfPayments; ++i) {
        remainingPayment -= monthlyPayment;
        remainingPayment += remainingPayment * interestRate;
    }

    return remainingPayment;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    double principal = 10000.0;  // Initial debt
    double interestRate = 0.05;   // Monthly interest rate (5%)
    int numberOfPayments = 36;     // Total number of payments

    double remainingPayment = calculateRemainingPayment(principal, interestRate, numberOfPayments);
    cout << "Remaining Payment: $" << remainingPayment << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The function `calculateRemainingPayment` takes three parameters: `principal`, `interestRate`, and `numberOfPayments`.
- **Interest Rate Check**: If the interest rate or the number of payments is zero, the function returns the principal directly since there would be no interest or payments to reduce the debt.
- **Monthly Payment Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the monthly payment is derived from the annuity formula.
- **Remaining Payment Calculation**: A loop iterates through each payment period, updating the remaining payment after each payment.
- **Main Function**: An example usage of the function is provided in the `main` function.

This C++ code should work similarly to the original JavaScript function.
