Here is the C++ version of your JavaScript function with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @return The calculated remaining payment.
 */
double calculateRemainingPayment(double principal, double interestRate, int numberOfPayments) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Note: Please provide the actual implementation logic inside the `calculateRemainingPayment` function in C++.
