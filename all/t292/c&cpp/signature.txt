```cpp
/**

 *
 * @param principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @returns - The calculated remaining payment.
 */
double calculateRemainingPayment(double principal, double interestRate, int numberOfPayments) {
}
```
