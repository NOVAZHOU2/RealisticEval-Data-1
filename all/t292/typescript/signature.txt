Sure! Here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param {number} principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param {number} interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param {number} numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @returns {number} - The calculated remaining payment.
 */
function calculateRemainingPayment(principal: number, interestRate: number, numberOfPayments: number): number {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In TypeScript, you need to specify the types for each parameter and the return type of the function. This helps in catching errors at compile time rather than runtime.
