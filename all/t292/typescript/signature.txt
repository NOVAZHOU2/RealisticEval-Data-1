Here's the function signature updated to TypeScript, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the remaining payment for a loan based on the given debt, monthly interest rate, and total payments.
 *
 * @param {number} principal - The initial amount of the debt.
 * @param {number} interestRate - The monthly interest rate as a decimal.
 * @param {number} numberOfPayments - The total number of payments.
 * @returns {number} - The calculated remaining payment.
 */
function calculateRemainingPayment(
    principal: number,
    interestRate: number,
    numberOfPayments: number
): number {
}
```

This maintains the original documentation while adding type annotations.
