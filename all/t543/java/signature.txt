Hereâ€™s the Java code signature that mirrors the JavaScript one, including the comments:

```java
/**
 * Increments the entered number.
 * If the number is non-positive (<= 0), returns the original value.
 * If the number is positive, returns the value plus 1.
 *
 * @param num The number to increment.
 * @return The incremented value or the original number.
 */
public static int incrementNumber(int num) {
}
```

This signature keeps the same structure and comments as in the JavaScript version.
