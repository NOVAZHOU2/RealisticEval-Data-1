Here's how you can translate that JavaScript function into Python:

```python
def increment_number(num):
    if num <= 0:
        return num
    else:
        return num + 1
```

This Python function does exactly what your JavaScript function does: it checks whether the input number is less than or equal to zero, and if so, returns the number unchanged. Otherwise, it returns the number increased by one.
