Sure! Here's the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Increments the entered number.
 * If the number is non-positive (<= 0), returns the original value.
 * If the number is positive, returns the value plus 1.
 *
 * @param num - The number to increment.
 * @return The incremented value or the original number.
 */
int incrementNumber(int num);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same logic and documentation as your JavaScript function. It takes an integer `num` as input and returns an integer, which could either be the incremented value or the original number depending on its sign.
