Certainly! Below is the C++ code signature with the same comments as your JavaScript function:

```cpp
/**
 * Increments the entered number.
 * If the number is non-positive (<= 0), returns the original value.
 * If the number is positive, returns the value plus 1.
 *
 * @param num - The number to increment.
 * @return The incremented value or the original number.
 */
int incrementNumber(int num);
```

This C++ function signature matches the behavior of your JavaScript function, including the comments and the return type. Note that in C++, we typically use `int` for integers, so I've changed the parameter and return types to `int`. If you need to handle floating-point numbers, you can replace `int` with `double` or `float`.
