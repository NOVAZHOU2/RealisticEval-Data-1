Sure! Here's the equivalent Python code for your JavaScript function:

```python
def count_numbers(s):
    """
    Count the number of numbers in a string.

    :param s: The string from which to count numeric digits.
    :return: The total count of numeric digits found in the string.
    """
    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)
```

This Python function `count_numbers` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of numeric digits in the string. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method. If the character is a digit, `isdigit()` returns `True`, contributing 1 to the sum; otherwise, it returns `False`, contributing 0.
