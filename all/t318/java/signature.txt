Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code signature with comments:

```java
/**
 * Count the number of numeric digits in a string.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to count numeric digits.
 * @returns The total count of numeric digits found in the string.
 */
public static int countNumbers(String str) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

You can fill in the implementation inside the method as needed. Let me know if you need any further help!
