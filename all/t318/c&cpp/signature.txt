Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of numbers in a string
 *
 * @param str - The string from which to count numeric digits.
 * @return The total count of numeric digits found in the string.
 */
int countNumbers(const std::string& str);
```

This C++ function signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as the original JavaScript function. It takes a `const std::string&` as input and returns an `int`.
