Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your Jest test case using `describe`:

```typescript
import { countNumbers } from './countNumbers'; // Adjust the import path accordingly

describe('countNumbers', () => {
  it('should count the number of numeric digits in a string', () => {
    expect(countNumbers("abc123")).toBe(3);
    expect(countNumbers("no numbers here!")).toBe(0);
    expect(countNumbers("42 is the answer!")).toBe(2);
    expect(countNumbers("1a2b3c4d5e")).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

In this example:
- I've assumed that the `countNumbers` function is defined in a file named `countNumbers.ts`.
- The `describe` block groups related tests together under the name "countNumbers".
- Each `it` (or `test`) block contains an individual test case with an expected result.

Make sure you have the necessary setup for running TypeScript and Jest in your project, including appropriate Jest configuration files (`jest.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`).
