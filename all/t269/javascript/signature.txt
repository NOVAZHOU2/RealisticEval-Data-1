Here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether the IP address is a legal IP address.
 * 
 * @param {string} ip - The IP address in string format.
 * 
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the IP is compliant, False otherwise.
 */
function isCompliantIP(ip) {
    // Function body would go here
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function is not provided here, only the function signature and comments have been translated.
