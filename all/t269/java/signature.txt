Sure! Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to a Java method signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Check whether the IP address is a legal IP address.
 *
 * @param ip The IP address in string format.
 * @return True if the IP is compliant, False otherwise.
 */
public boolean isCompliantIp(String ip) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, methods are defined within classes and have a return type specified. The `@param` tag is used for method parameters, and the `@return` tag is used to describe what the method returns.
