Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code with appropriate documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Check whether the IP address is a legal IP address.
 * 
 * @param ip The IP address in string format.
 * @returns True if the IP is compliant, False otherwise.
 */
function isCompliantIP(ip: string): boolean {
    // Implementation of the function goes here.
}
```

The function signature and documentation have been converted to match TypeScript conventions. You would then implement the logic inside the function body as needed.
