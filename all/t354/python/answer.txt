Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function, including appropriate comments:
python
import math  # Import the math library for the exp function

def gaussian_weight(intensity_diff: float, sigma_color: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Gaussian weight based on the difference in intensity and a color standard deviation.

    The Gaussian weight is calculated using the formula:
    weight = exp(- (intensity_diff^2) / (2 * sigma_color^2))

    :param intensity_diff: The difference in intensity, which is used to compute the weight.
    :param sigma_color: The standard deviation for the color, affecting the spread of the weight.
    :return: The Gaussian weight as a float.
    """
    # Calculate the squared intensity difference
    squared_diff = intensity_diff ** 2
    # Calculate the denominator using sigma_color squared
    denominator = 2 * (sigma_color ** 2)
    # Calculate and return the Gaussian weight
    return math.exp(-squared_diff / denominator)
Explanation:
Import Statement: The math module is imported to use the exp function for exponential calculations.
Function Definition: The function is defined as gaussian_weight, following Python naming conventions (using snake_case).
Type Hints: The parameters intensity_diff and sigma_color are annotated with their expected types (float), and the return type is specified as float.
Docstring: The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value, similar to the C++ comments.
Calculations:
The squared intensity difference is calculated using intensity_diff ** 2.
The denominator is calculated using sigma_color ** 2 and multiplied by 2.
The Gaussian weight is computed using math.exp() and returned.
This code is ready to be used in a Python program and performs the same calculations as the original C++ function.
