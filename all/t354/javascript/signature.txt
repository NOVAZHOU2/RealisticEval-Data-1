Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature that translates the provided C++ function, along with the comments:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the Gaussian weight based on the difference in intensity and a color standard deviation.
 *
 * The Gaussian weight is calculated using the formula:
 * weight = exp(- (intensityDiff^2) / (2 * sigmaColor^2))
 *
 * @param {number} intensityDiff The difference in intensity, which is used to compute the weight.
 * @param {number} sigmaColor The standard deviation for the color, affecting the spread of the weight.
 * @return {number} The Gaussian weight.
 */
function gaussianWeight(intensityDiff, sigmaColor) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Function Declaration**: Replaced `inline float` with `function` keyword; JavaScript does not have a notion of inline functions like C++.
2. **Parameter Naming**: Converted `intensity_diff` and `sigma_color` to camelCase (`intensityDiff` and `sigmaColor`) for JavaScript conventions.
3. **Type Annotations**: Used JSDoc to specify parameter and return types in a format suitable for JavaScript.
4. **Comments**: Maintained the multi-line comment structure while adapting the C++ style to JavaScript. 

This structure keeps the original intent while fitting JavaScript standards.
