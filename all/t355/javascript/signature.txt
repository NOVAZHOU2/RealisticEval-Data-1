Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the spatial weight based on the difference in spatial coordinates and a space standard deviation.
 *
 * The spatial weight is calculated using the formula:
 * weight = exp(- (spatial_diff^2) / (2 * sigma_space^2))
 *
 * @param {number} spatial_diff The difference in spatial coordinates, which is used to compute the weight.
 * @param {number} sigma_space The standard deviation for spatial distance, affecting the spread of the weight.
 * @return {number} The spatial weight.
 */
function spatialWeight(spatial_diff, sigma_space) {
    // Validate that sigma_space is greater than zero to avoid division by zero
    if (sigma_space <= 0) {
        throw new RangeError("sigma_space must be greater than zero.");
    }

    // Calculate the squared spatial difference
    const squared_diff = spatial_diff * spatial_diff;

    // Calculate the denominator using sigma_space squared
    const denominator = 2 * sigma_space * sigma_space;

    // Calculate and return the spatial weight
    return Math.exp(-squared_diff / denominator);
}
```
