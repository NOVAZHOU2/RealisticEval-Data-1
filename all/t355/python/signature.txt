Here's the equivalent Python code signature for the provided C++ function, with comments converted to Python style:
python
import math  # Include math for the exp function

def spatial_weight(spatial_diff: float, sigma_space: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the spatial weight based on the difference in spatial coordinates and a space standard deviation.

    The spatial weight is calculated using the formula:
    weight = exp(- (spatial_diff^2) / (2 * sigma_space^2))

    :param spatial_diff: The difference in spatial coordinates, which is used to compute the weight.
    :param sigma_space: The standard deviation for spatial distance, affecting the spread of the weight.
    :return: The spatial weight as a float.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Changes Made:
Import Statement: The #include <cmath> directive is replaced with import math, following Python's import conventions.
Function Definition:
The function name is changed to spatial_weight, adhering to Python's snake_case naming convention.
The parameters are annotated with their expected types (float).
The return type is specified as float.
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted to a Python docstring format using triple quotes (""").
The description is retained, and the parameter and return information is included in the docstring using Python's standard format.
Function Body:
A placeholder pass statement is included in the function body, indicating where the implementation would go.
This Python signature maintains the structure and intent of the original C++ code while following Python conventions.
