Here's the equivalent TypeScript function signature along with the documentation comments using JSDoc style:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the average difference between consecutive integers in the provided list.
 *
 * @param {number[]} numbers - A list of integers.
 * @returns {number} The average difference between consecutive integers, or 0 if there are fewer than 2 integers.
 */
function calculateAverageDifference(numbers: number[]): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes and Adaptations:

1. **Function Signature**: The TypeScript function is defined similarly, with the parameter typed as `number[]` to represent an array of numbers and the return type as `number`.

2. **JSDoc Comments**: The Python docstring has been converted to JSDoc format. The parameter and return types are clearly documented, providing the same level of detail as the original.

3. **Function Body**: The implementation section is marked with a comment to indicate where the function logic would go, mirroring the original Python function's intent. 

This TypeScript snippet preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to TypeScript's conventions.
