Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the average difference between consecutive integers in the provided array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} numbers - An array of integers.
 * @returns {number} The average difference between consecutive integers, or 0 if there are fewer than 2 integers.
 */
function calculateAverageDifference(numbers) {
    // Check if the list is valid (at least 2 numbers)
    if (!numbers || numbers.length < 2) {
        return 0.0; // Not enough data to calculate differences
    }

    // Calculate differences from the previous data
    const differences = numbers.slice(1).map((num, i) => num - numbers[i]);

    // Calculate the average of the differences
    return differences.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0) / differences.length;
}
```
