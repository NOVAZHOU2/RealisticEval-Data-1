Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Java JUnit test cases to Python's unittest framework.
Java Test Cases
Here's the original Java code using JUnit:
java
package org.real.temp;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import java.util.List;

public class Tester {
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAverageDifference_PositiveIntegers() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(10, 20, 30, 40);
        double result = Answer.calculateAverageDifference(numbers);
        double expected = 10.0;
        assertEquals(expected, result, "The average difference should be 10.0");
    }

    @Test
    public void testCalculateAverageDifference_MixedPositiveAndNegative() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(-10, 0, 10, 20);
        double result = Answer.calculateAverageDifference(numbers);
        double expected = 10.0;
        assertEquals(expected, result, "The average difference should be 10.0");
    }

    @Test
    public void testCalculateAverageDifference_SameValues() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(5, 5, 5, 5);
        double result = Answer.calculateAverageDifference(numbers);
        double expected = 0.0;
        assertEquals(expected, result, "The average difference should be 0.0 as all values are the same");
    }

    @Test
    public void testCalculateAverageDifference_SingleElement() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(100);
        double result = Answer.calculateAverageDifference(numbers);
        double expected = 0.0;  // Not enough data to calculate differences
        assertEquals(expected, result, "The average difference should be 0.0 for a single element list");
    }

    @Test
    public void testCalculateAverageDifference_EmptyList() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of();
        double result = Answer.calculateAverageDifference(numbers);
        double expected = 0.0;  // Not enough data to calculate differences
        assertEquals(expected, result, "The average difference should be 0.0 for an empty list");
    }
}
Converted Python Unit Test Cases
Below is the Python code using the unittest framework:
python
import unittest
from typing import List

# Assuming the Answer class is defined in another module
# from your_module import Answer 

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_calculate_average_difference_positive_integers(self):
        numbers: List[int] = [10, 20, 30, 40]
        result = Answer.calculate_average_difference(numbers)
        expected = 10.0
        self.assertAlmostEqual(expected, result, msg="The average difference should be 10.0")

    def test_calculate_average_difference_mixed_positive_and_negative(self):
        numbers: List[int] = [-10, 0, 10, 20]
        result = Answer.calculate_average_difference(numbers)
        expected = 10.0
        self.assertAlmostEqual(expected, result, msg="The average difference should be 10.0")

    def test_calculate_average_difference_same_values(self):
        numbers: List[int] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
        result = Answer.calculate_average_difference(numbers)
        expected = 0.0
        self.assertAlmostEqual(expected, result, msg="The average difference should be 0.0 as all values are the same")

    def test_calculate_average_difference_single_element(self):
        numbers: List[int] = [100]
        result = Answer.calculate_average_difference(numbers)
        expected = 0.0  # Not enough data to calculate differences
        self.assertAlmostEqual(expected, result, msg="The average difference should be 0.0 for a single element list")

    def test_calculate_average_difference_empty_list(self):
        numbers: List[int] = []
        result = Answer.calculate_average_difference(numbers)
        expected = 0.0  # Not enough data to calculate differences
        self.assertAlmostEqual(expected, result, msg="The average difference should be 0.0 for an empty list")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Python Code:
Imports: The unittest module is imported for creating test cases. If your Answer class is in a different module, you'd also import it as shown in the comment.
Test Class: The test class TestAnswer inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Test Methods: Each test method follows the naming convention of test_* to ensure that unittest recognizes them as tests.
Assertions: The assertAlmostEqual method is used for floating-point comparisons to avoid issues with floating-point precision.
Main Check: The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the test cases run when the script is executed directly.
This Python test suite is functionally equivalent to your original Java JUnit tests. You can run it to validate the behavior of the calculate_average_difference function in the Answer class.
