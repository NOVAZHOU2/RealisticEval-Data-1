Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Iterates through the array of elements until the first null is encountered,
 * returning a new array that includes all elements before the null.
 *
 * @param {any[]} array - The array to iterate through.
 * @returns {any[]} - A new array containing elements before the first null.
 */
function elementsBeforeNull(array: any[]): any[] {
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- `any[]` is used for the type of the input and output arrays. This means the array can contain any type of element.
- The type annotations help ensure type safety in your code.
