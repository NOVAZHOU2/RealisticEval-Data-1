Here's the C++ code signature with comments, mirroring the JavaScript style:

```cpp
/**
 * Iterates through the vector of elements until the first null is encountered,
 * returning a new vector that includes all elements before the null.
 *
 * @param std::vector<int*> array - The vector to iterate through.
 * @returns std::vector<int*> - A new vector containing elements before the first null.
 */
std::vector<int*> elementsBeforeNull(const std::vector<int*>& array) {
}
```

Feel free to replace `int*` with the appropriate type you are working with!
