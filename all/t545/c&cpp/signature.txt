Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Iterates through the array of elements until the first null is encountered,
 * returning a new vector that includes all elements before the null.
 *
 * @param array - The array to iterate through.
 * @return A new vector containing elements before the first null.
 */
std::vector<int> elementsBeforeNull(const std::vector<int>& array);
```

In this C++ version:
- `std::vector<int>` is used instead of JavaScript's array.
- The function returns a `std::vector<int>` which contains the elements before the first null (assuming null is represented by 0 for simplicity).
- The input parameter is passed by const reference (`const std::vector<int>&`) to avoid unnecessary copying of the array.

If you want to handle different types or if null is represented differently in your context, please provide additional details so I can adjust the signature accordingly.
