Here is the equivalent C++ code for your JavaScript function:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> elementsBeforeNull(const std::vector<int>& array) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& elem : array) {
        if (elem == 0) break; // Assuming 0 represents null in C++
        result.push_back(elem);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This C++ function iterates over the input vector and adds each element to the `result` vector until it encounters an element equal to 0 (assuming 0 represents null). It then breaks out of the loop and returns the `result` vector.

Please note that this assumes that you're working with integers and using 0 to represent null. If you're dealing with other data types or using different values to represent null, you'll need to adjust the comparison accordingly.
