Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Iterates through the array of elements until the first null is encountered,
 * returning a new list that includes all elements before the null.
 *
 * @param array - The array to iterate through.
 * @returns - A new list containing elements before the first null.
 */
public static List<Object> elementsBeforeNull(Object[] array) {
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from your JavaScript code.
