Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code signature for the given JavaScript function, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Iterates through the array of elements until the first null is encountered,
 * returning a new array that includes all elements before the null.
 *
 * @param array - The array to iterate through.
 * @return A new array containing elements before the first null.
 */
public static Object[] elementsBeforeNull(Object[] array) {
}
```

This Java method signature matches the functionality and purpose of the original JavaScript function. It takes an array of `Object` types as input and returns an array of `Object` types, which allows it to handle arrays of any object type.
