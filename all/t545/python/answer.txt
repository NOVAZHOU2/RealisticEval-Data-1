Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function that iterates through an array until it encounters the first null value (represented as None in Python) and returns a new list containing all elements before the None:
Python Code
python
from typing import List, Any

def elements_before_null(array: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Iterates through the array of elements until the first None is encountered,
    returning a new list that includes all elements before None.

    Args:
        array (List[Any]): The array to iterate through.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A new list containing elements before the first None.
    """
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the result
    for element in array:
        if element is None:  # Exit the loop if None is encountered
            break
        result.append(element)  # Add the current element to the result list
    return result  # Return the result list
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function is named elements_before_null, following the Python naming convention (snake_case).
It accepts a parameter array, which is expected to be a list of elements (List[Any] allows for a list of any data type).
Docstring:
A docstring describes the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return type, similar to the JavaScript comments.
Initialization:
An empty list named result is initialized to store elements encountered before None.
Looping Through the Array:
A for loop iterates through each element in the input array.
The if element is None statement checks for the first occurrence of None and exits the loop if found.
Appending Elements:
If the element is not None, it is added to the result list using result.append(element).
Return Statement:
Finally, the result list is returned, which contains all elements up to (but not including) the first None.
This Python function retains the functionality of the original JavaScript code while conforming to Python syntax and conventions.
