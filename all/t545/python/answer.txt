Here's how you can write the equivalent Python function:

```python
def elements_before_null(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] is None:
            return array[:i]
    return array
```

This Python function iterates through the list of elements until it encounters the first `None` value (which is analogous to `null` in JavaScript), and returns a new list with all elements before the `None`. If no `None` value is found, it simply returns the original list.
