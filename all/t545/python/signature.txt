Sure! Here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to Python while keeping the comments:

```python
# Iterates through the list of elements until the first None is encountered,
# returning a new list that includes all elements before the None.

def elements_before_null(lst):
```

This Python function signature follows the same logic and purpose as the original JavaScript function, but it uses Python conventions such as `None` instead of `null` and `lst` instead of `array`.
