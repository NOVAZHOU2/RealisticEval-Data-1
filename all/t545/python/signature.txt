Sure! Below is the equivalent Python function with the same comments:

```python
def elements_before_null(array):
    """
    Iterates through the list of elements until the first None is encountered,
    returning a new list that includes all elements before the None.

    :param array: The list to iterate through.
    :return: A new list containing elements before the first None.
    """
```

This Python function follows the same logic and structure as your JavaScript function, including the docstring for documentation purposes.
