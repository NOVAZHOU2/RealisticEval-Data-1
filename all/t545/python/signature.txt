To convert the provided JavaScript function signature to a Python function signature, including a docstring, here is the equivalent Python code:
Python Code Signature
python
from typing import List, Any

def elements_before_null(array: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Iterates through the array of elements until the first None is encountered,
    returning a new list that includes all elements before None.

    Args:
        array (List[Any]): The array to iterate through.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A new list containing elements before the first None.
    """
    pass  # The function implementation would go here
Explanation:
Importing List and Any:
The List and Any types from the typing module are imported to specify that the function works with a list of elements of any type.
Function Definition:
The function is named elements_before_null, using snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
array: List[Any] indicates that the parameter array is expected to be a list containing elements of any type.
-> List[Any] specifies that the function will return a list of elements of any type.
Docstring:
A docstring describes the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and return type, similar to the JavaScript comments.
pass Statement:
The pass statement indicates that the function is currently unimplemented but defined.
This Python function signature accurately reflects the intent and structure of the original JavaScript function signature while following Python conventions.
