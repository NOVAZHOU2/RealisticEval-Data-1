Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
const { Document } = require('docx');

/**
 * Extracts text content from a given Word file (.docx).
 * 
 * @param {string} docxFilepath The path to the Word file.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the extracted text content.
 */
async function extractTextFromWord(docxFilepath) {
    const doc = new Document({ filePath: docxFilepath });
    const text = await doc.getText();
    return text;
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, especially when using async/await, the function returns a `Promise` that eventually resolves to the desired value (`string` in this case). Thus, the return type is annotated as `Promise<string>` instead of just `string`. Also, the `docx` library for JavaScript is used differently than the Python `python-docx` library. In JavaScript, we use `Document` to load the file and then call `getText()` to get the text content.
