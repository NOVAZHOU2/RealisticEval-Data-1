Here's how you can write the JavaScript code signature for the given Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts text content from a given Word file (.docx).
 *
 * @param {string} docxFilePath - The path to the Word file.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves with the extracted text content.
 */
async function extractTextFromWord(docxFilePath) {
```

In this JavaScript version, I've used JSDoc style comments to document the function. The `@param` tag is used to describe the input parameter and its type, while the `@returns` tag describes the return value of the function. The `async` keyword indicates that the function returns a Promise, which is typical in JavaScript when dealing with asynchronous operations like reading files.
