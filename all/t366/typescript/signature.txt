Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function:

```typescript
import { Document } from 'docx';

/**
 * Extracts text content from a given Word file (.docx).
 * 
 * @param docxFilePath The path to the Word file.
 * @returns The extracted text content.
 */
function extractTextFromWord(docxFilePath: string): string {
    const doc = new Document({ filePath: docxFilePath });
    return doc.getText();
}
```

Note that for this TypeScript code to work, you would need a compatible library that provides the `Document` class with similar functionality as the Python `docx` library. If such a library does not exist, you might need to implement or find an alternative solution for reading .docx files in TypeScript.
