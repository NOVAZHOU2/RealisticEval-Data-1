Sure! Here is the equivalent TypeScript code signature for your Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
import { Document } from 'mammoth';

/**
 * Extracts text content from a given Word file (.docx).
 *
 * @param {string} docxFilePath - The path to the Word file.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} - A promise that resolves with the extracted text content.
 */
async function extractTextFromWord(docxFilePath: string): Promise<string> {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've used `Promise` to handle asynchronous operations, which is common when dealing with file I/O or other operations that might take time. The return type of the function is now `Promise<string>` to reflect this.
