To convert your Python unittest test class into a C++ test case using Catch2, you'll need to define a similar function in C++ and then write tests for it. Below is an example of how you might do that:

1. **Define the Function in C++**:
   First, you need to create a function in C++ that does the same thing as your `extract_text_from_word` function in Python. For simplicity, let's assume this function is already implemented and named `extractTextFromWord`.

2. **Write the Test Case Using Catch2**:
   Next, you will write the test cases using Catch2. If you haven't already installed Catch2, you can download it from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) or install it via your package manager.

Here's an example of how you might write the test case:

```cpp
#include "catch.hpp"
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

// Assuming this function is already implemented somewhere in your project
std::string extractTextFromWord(const std::string& docxFilePath);

TEST_CASE("Extract Text From Word", "[word]") {
    // Path to the test .docx file
    std::string docxFilePath = "path/to/your/test.docx";

    // Expected output
    std::string expectedOutput = "This is the expected text content.";

    // Actual output from the function
    std::string actualOutput = extractTextFromWord(docxFilePath);

    // Check if the actual output matches the expected output
    REQUIRE(actualOutput == expectedOutput);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    return Catch::Session().run(argc, argv);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The first line includes the Catch2 header file. Make sure this is in your include path.

2. **Test Case Definition**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a test case with a name and a tag. In this case, the test case is named "Extract Text From Word" and has a tag `[word]`.

3. **Path to the Test File**: Specify the path to your `.docx` file. Replace `"path/to/your/test.docx"` with the actual path to your test file.

4. **Expected Output**: Define the expected output as a string.

5. **Actual Output**: Call the `extractTextFromWord` function and store the result in `actualOutput`.

6. **Assertion**: Use the `REQUIRE` macro to check if the `actualOutput` matches the `expectedOutput`. If they don't match, the test will fail.

7. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes and runs the Catch2 session.

Make sure you have a build system set up to compile and run your C++ code with Catch2. This could be done using CMake, Makefiles, or any other build tool you prefer.
