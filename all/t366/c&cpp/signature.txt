Here is the equivalent C++ code for the provided Python function:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
// Note: For actual implementation, you would need a library like libdocx or a similar C++ library to handle .docx files.

std::string extract_text_from_word(const std::string& docx_file_path) {
    /*
    Extracts text content from a given Word file (.docx).

    Args:
        docx_file_path (std::string): The path to the Word file.

    Returns:
        std::string: The extracted text content.
    */
    // Placeholder implementation (you would need an actual library to read .docx files)
    return "Sample text extracted from the document";
}
```

In this translation:
- The Python `str` type is converted to `std::string` in C++.
- The function signature is adjusted to match C++ syntax.
- Comments and documentation are converted to C++ style comments.
