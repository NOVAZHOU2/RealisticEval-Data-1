Here's how you can convert your Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Formats a string by prepending '> ' to each line and ensuring proper
 * formatting of code blocks.
 *
 * @param {string} x - The input string to be formatted. If the input is not a
 * string, it will be converted to one.
 * @returns {string} - The formatted string with each line prefixed by '> ' and
 * with balanced code block delimiters.
 */
```

In JavaScript, there isn't a direct equivalent for type annotations like in Python (`str`), but you can use JSDoc comments to document types.
