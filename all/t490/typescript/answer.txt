Sure! Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function:

```typescript
function formatStr(x: any): string {
    /**
     * Formats a string by prepending '> ' to each line and ensuring proper
     * formatting of code blocks.
     *
     * @param {any} x - The input to be formatted. It will be converted to a string if it is not already one.
     * @returns {string} - The formatted string with each line prefixed by '> ' and
     *                     with balanced code block delimiters.
     */

    // Convert x to string if it's not already a string.
    let strX = typeof x === 'string' ? x : String(x);

    // Ensure there is a matching number of code block delimiters.
    // If the count of delimiters is odd, append an additional one to balance.
    const delimiterCount = (strX.match(/```/g) || []).length;
    if (delimiterCount % 2 === 1) {
        strX += "\n```";
    }

    // Format each line by prepending '> ' and join them with newlines.
    const formattedLines = strX.split("\n").map(line => "> " + line);

    // Return the final formatted string.
    return formattedLines.join("\n");
}

// Example usage
const input = "This is a test\nIt works well\n```code block\nMore code here\n```";
console.log(formatStr(input));
```

### Explanation:
1. **Type Annotations**: The function `formatStr` takes an `any` type as its argument and returns a `string`. This is because the input can be of any type but will be converted to a string.
2. **Conversion to String**: The input `x` is converted to a string using a ternary operator.
3. **Delimiter Count**: The number of code block delimiters (`"```"`) is counted using a regular expression and adjusted if the count is odd.
4. **Formatting Lines**: Each line is prepended with `"> "` and then joined back together with newlines.
5. **Return Value**: The final formatted string is returned.

This TypeScript code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original Python code.
