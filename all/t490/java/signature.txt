Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided Python function `format_str`, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Formats a string by prepending '> ' to each line and ensuring proper
 * formatting of code blocks.
 *
 * @param x The input string to be formatted. If the input is not a
 *          string, it will be converted to one.
 * @return The formatted string with each line prefixed by '> ' and
 *         with balanced code block delimiters.
 */
public String formatStr(String x) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, method signatures include the return type, the method name, and the parameter types, followed by any annotations or documentation comments.
