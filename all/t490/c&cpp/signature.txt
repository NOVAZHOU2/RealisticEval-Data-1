Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Formats a string by prepending '> ' to each line and ensuring proper
 * formatting of code blocks.
 *
 * @param x The input string to be formatted. If the input is not a
 *            string, it will be converted to one.
 * @return The formatted string with each line prefixed by '> ' and
 *         with balanced code block delimiters.
 */
std::string formatStr(const std::string& x);
```

This C++ function signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your Python function.
