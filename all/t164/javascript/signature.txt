Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature with comments preserved:

```javascript
/**
 * The Uint8 array is converted into 4 Base64 characters as a group of 3 bytes for processing, and the output of less than 3 is filled with =, and the resulting Base64 string is returned
 *
 * @param {Uint8Array} uint8Array - The Uint8Array to be converted.
 * @returns {string} - The resulting Base64-encoded string.

function uint8ArrayToBase64(uint8Array) {
