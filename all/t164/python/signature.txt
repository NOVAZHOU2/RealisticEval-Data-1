Here’s how you can translate the provided TypeScript function signature to Python while keeping the comments intact. In Python, you can use the bytes type to represent byte arrays, and the built-in base64 module can be used for Base64 encoding.
Here’s the equivalent Python code signature:
python
import base64

def uint8_array_to_base64(uint8_array: bytes) -> str:
    """
    The Unit8 array is converted into 4 Base64 characters as a group of 3 bytes for processing, 
    and the output of less than 3 is filled with =, and the resulting Base64 string is returned.

    :param uint8_array: The Uint8Array to be converted (as bytes).
    :return: The resulting Base64-encoded string.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Type Annotations:
In TypeScript, Uint8Array is used, while in Python, the closest equivalent is bytes.
The return type in both cases is string in TypeScript and str in Python.
Docstring:
The original comments have been transformed into a Python docstring using triple quotes, which is a common way to document functions in Python.
Function Body:
I've included a pass statement in the function body to indicate where the implementation would go. You can replace this with the actual logic for converting the byte array to a Base64 string.
Feel free to implement the body of the function using Python's base64 library to perform the conversion! If you need help with that implementation, let me know!
