Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments preserved, adapted from the TypeScript version:

```java
/**
 * The byte array is converted into 4 Base64 characters as a group of 3 bytes for processing, 
 * and the output of less than 3 is filled with =, and the resulting Base64 string is returned.
 *
 * @param uint8Array - The byte array to be converted.
 * @returns The resulting Base64-encoded string.
 */
public static String uint8ArrayToBase64(byte[] uint8Array) {
}
```

### Notes:
- The parameter type has been changed from `Uint8Array` to `byte[]`.
- The return type has been changed to match Java's conventions.
