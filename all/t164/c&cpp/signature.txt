Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments retained:

```cpp
/**
 * The Uint8 array is converted into 4 Base64 characters as a group of 3 bytes for processing, and the output of less than 3 is filled with =, and the resulting Base64 string is returned
 *
 * @param {std::vector<uint8_t>} uint8Array - The Uint8Array to be converted.
 * @returns {std::string} - The resulting Base64-encoded string.
 */
std::string uint8ArrayToBase64(const std::vector<uint8_t>& uint8Array) {
}
``` 

This maintains the original functionality while adapting it to C++.
