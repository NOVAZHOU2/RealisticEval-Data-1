To convert the TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while retaining the comments, you can use Python's type hinting for the function signature. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
python
def format_date(date_string: str) -> str:
    """ 
    Converts a date string into a relative time description. 
    For example, now time 2024-08-25T12:00:00 
         input: 2024-08-24T12:00:00 output: 1 day ago 
         input: 2024-08-25T07:00:00 output: 5 hours ago 

    Args:
        date_string (str): The date string to convert.

    Returns:
        str: A user-friendly string representing the relative time difference from the current date.
    """
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name: The TypeScript function formatDate is converted to format_date following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations: The TypeScript types string are changed to Python types str for both the parameter and the return type.
Docstring Format: The comment style has been updated to a Python docstring format, using triple quotes (""") for multi-line comments. The structure of the docstring has also been modified slightly to match common Python conventions for documentation, using Args and Returns.
This signature provides clear information about the function's purpose, parameters, and return type in Python.
