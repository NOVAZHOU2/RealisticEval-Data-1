Below is the equivalent Python code using the unittest framework, adapted from the provided C++ Catch2 test case for the reverse_range function.
Python Test Code
python
import unittest

def reverse_range(v: list[int], a: int, b: int) -> None:
    """
    Reverse the order of elements in the list v within the specified range [a, b].
    """
    if a < 0 or b >= len(v) or a > b:
        return  # Do nothing for invalid ranges
    v[a:b + 1] = reversed(v[a:b + 1])


class Tester(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_reverse_entire_vector(self):
        v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        reverse_range(v, 0, 4)
        expected = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        self.assertEqual(v, expected)

    def test_reverse_subrange_in_the_middle(self):
        v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
        reverse_range(v, 2, 5)
        expected = [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7, 8]
        self.assertEqual(v, expected)

    def test_reverse_single_element_range(self):
        v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        reverse_range(v, 2, 2)
        expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        self.assertEqual(v, expected)

    def test_reverse_range_with_invalid_indices(self):
        v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        reverse_range(v, -1, 3)  # Invalid start index
        expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # No change
        self.assertEqual(v, expected)

    def test_reverse_range_at_end_of_vector(self):
        v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        reverse_range(v, 3, 5)
        expected = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
        self.assertEqual(v, expected)

Explanation of Changes:
Imports:
The unittest module is imported to facilitate the unit testing framework.
Function Definition:
The reverse_range function is included to match the original functionality from C++.
Class Definition:
A class Tester is defined, inheriting from unittest.TestCase, to organize the test cases.
Test Methods:
Each C++ SECTION is converted into a method within the Tester class.
The assertions are handled by self.assertEqual(), which compares the modified list with the expected result.
Main Block:
The unittest.main() call at the end ensures that the test suite runs when the script is executed.
Running the Tests:
You can run this test code in a Python environment by saving it to a file (e.g., test_reverse_range.py) and executing it. The output will indicate whether all tests have passed or if any have failed.
