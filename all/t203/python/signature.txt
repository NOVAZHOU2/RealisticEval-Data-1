Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted to Python, with comments adjusted to Python style while preserving the original content:
python
def reverse_range(v: list[int], a: int, b: int) -> None:
    """
    Reverse the order of elements in the list v within the specified range [a, b].

    :param v: Reference to the list of integers to be modified.
    :param a: The starting index of the range to be reversed.
    :param b: The ending index of the range to be reversed.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
Changed from reverseRange (C++) to reverse_range (Python) to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Parameter Types:
The parameters v, a, and b are annotated with their types: list[int] for a list of integers, and int for the indices.
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted into a docstring using triple quotes, maintaining the information about the function's purpose and parameters but adapting it to Python syntax.
Function Body:
The function body is marked with pass, indicating where the implementation would go.
