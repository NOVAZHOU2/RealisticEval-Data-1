To convert the Java function signature you provided to Python, we will adjust the syntax and data types accordingly. Hereâ€™s how the function signature would look in Python:
Python Function Signature
python
def multiply_matrix(matrix_a: list[list[float]], matrix_b: list[list[float]]) -> list[list[float]]:
Breakdown of the Signature:
Function Name:
The Java method name multiplyMatrix is converted to Python's naming convention, which typically uses snake_case. So it becomes multiply_matrix.
Parameters:
In Java, double[][] is used to represent a 2D array of doubles. In Python, we use list[list[float]] to indicate a list of lists containing floating-point numbers.
Return Type:
The return type in Java (double[][]) is also represented as list[list[float]] in Python.
Type Hints:
The use of -> indicates the return type in Python, similar to how Java uses the return type before the method name.
Complete Example with Function Docstring
If you want to include the function docstring in Python (similar to the Java comments), it would look like this:
python
def multiply_matrix(matrix_a: list[list[float]], matrix_b: list[list[float]]) -> list[list[float]]:
    """
    Multiplies two matrices.

    :param matrix_a: The first matrix
    :param matrix_b: The second matrix
    :return: The resulting matrix after multiplication
    :raises ValueError: If the matrices are incompatible for multiplication
    """
    # Function implementation will go here
Summary
This Python signature preserves the functionality and intent of the original Java method while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions. Let me know if you need further assistance!
