Sure! Below is the Python code equivalent to the Java code you provided for multiplying two matrices:
python
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def multiply_matrix(matrix_a, matrix_b):
        """
        Multiplies two matrices.

        :param matrix_a: The first matrix
        :param matrix_b: The second matrix
        :return: The resulting matrix after multiplication
        :raises ValueError: If the matrices are incompatible for multiplication
        """
        # Get dimensions of the input matrices
        rows_a = len(matrix_a)        # Number of rows in matrixA
        cols_a = len(matrix_a[0])     # Number of columns in matrixA
        rows_b = len(matrix_b)        # Number of rows in matrixB
        cols_b = len(matrix_b[0])     # Number of columns in matrixB

        # Validate matrix dimensions for multiplication
        if rows_b != cols_a:
            raise ValueError("Incompatible matrix dimensions for multiplication")

        # Initialize the result matrix
        result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_b)] for _ in range(rows_a)]

        # Perform matrix multiplication
        for i in range(rows_a):
            for j in range(cols_b):
                for k in range(cols_a):
                    result[i][j] += matrix_a[i][k] * matrix_b[k][j]

        return result  # Return the resulting matrix
Key Differences Explained:
Static Method Declaration: In Python, the @staticmethod decorator is used to indicate that the method is static, similar to static in Java.
Matrix Initialization: The result matrix is initialized using a list comprehension in Python, which is more concise than the array initialization in Java.
Error Handling: Instead of IllegalArgumentException, Python uses ValueError to indicate incompatible dimensions.
Comments: Python uses # for single-line comments, while multi-line comments can be enclosed in triple quotes.
Example Usage:
You can use the multiply_matrix method like this:
python
matrix_a = [[1, 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]]

matrix_b = [[7, 8],
             [9, 10],
             [11, 12]]

result = Answer.multiply_matrix(matrix_a, matrix_b)
print(result)  # Output: [[58, 64], [139, 154]]
This Python code will perform the same matrix multiplication as the Java code you provided. Let me know if you need any more help!
