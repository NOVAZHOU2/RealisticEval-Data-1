Here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments converted to C++ style:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param log_file_path Path to the log file.
 */
void extract_log_entries(const std::string& log_file_path) {
    // Function body here
}
```

Explanation:
1. The `def` keyword in Python is replaced with the return type `void` in C++, indicating that the function does not return any value.
2. The Python type annotation `str` is replaced with `std::string` in C++.
3. The Python docstring is converted into a multi-line comment block using `/** */` syntax, which is commonly used for documenting functions in C++.
4. The parameter description in the comment is adjusted to match C++ conventions.
