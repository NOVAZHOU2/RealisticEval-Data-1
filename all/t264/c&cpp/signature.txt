Certainly! Below is the C++ code signature that mirrors the Python function signature you provided, with the necessary comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param logFilePath The path to the log file.
 */
```

This C++ comment block follows the Doxygen style, which is widely used in many C++ projects for documentation purposes. It includes a brief description of what the function does and details about its parameters.
