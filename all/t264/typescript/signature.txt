Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param logFilePath - Path to the log file.
 */
function extractLogEntries(logFilePath: string): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function `extractLogEntries` takes a single parameter `logFilePath` of type `string` and returns `void`, which means it does not return any value. The comment above the function describes its purpose and parameters, just like in the original Python code.
