Here is your Python function converted into TypeScript:

```typescript
function extractLogEntries(logFilePath: string): void {
    /**
     * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
     * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
     *
     * @param logFilePath - Path to the log file.
     */

}
```

In TypeScript, we don't need docstrings like in Python. Instead, we use JSDoc comments. Also, the return type `void` means that the function does not return any value. If you want to return something, you should specify its type instead of `void`.
