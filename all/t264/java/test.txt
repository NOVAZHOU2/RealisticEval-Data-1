It seems like the provided Python code snippet is incomplete and does not contain any test cases or the actual implementation of the `extract_log_entries` function. However, I can still provide you with a basic structure of how you could set up a JUnit test class in Java for a similar scenario.

Let's assume that there is a method `extractLogEntries` in a Java class that performs the same functionality as described in the Python docstring.

Here is the Java code for the equivalent JUnit test class:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Tester {

    // Assuming the class where extractLogEntries method is defined
    private LogProcessor logProcessor = new LogProcessor();

    @Test
    public void testExtractLogEntries() {
        // Arrange
        String logFilePath = "path/to/logfile.log";
        String expectedWarningFilePath = "path/to/warnings.log";
        String expectedErrorFilePath = "path/to/errors.log";
        String expectedCriticalFilePath = "path/to/criticals.log";
        String expectedAlertFilePath = "path/to/alerts.log";

        // Act
        logProcessor.extractLogEntries(logFilePath);

        // Assert
        // Check if the files were created and have the correct content
        // This part depends on how you implement the extractLogEntries method
        // For simplicity, let's assume we check if the files exist
        assertTrue("Warning file should exist", new File(expectedWarningFilePath).exists());
        assertTrue("Error file should exist", new File(expectedErrorFilePath).exists());
        assertTrue("Critical file should exist", new File(expectedCriticalFilePath).exists());
        assertTrue("Alert file should exist", new File(expectedAlertFilePath).exists());
    }
}

// Assuming the LogProcessor class definition
class LogProcessor {
    public void extractLogEntries(String logFilePath) {
        // Implementation to extract log entries and save them to different files
        // This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package and Class Definition**: The test class `Tester` is placed in the package `org.real.temp`.
2. **JUnit Annotations**: The `@Test` annotation is used to mark the test method.
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**:
   - **Arrange**: Set up the necessary inputs and expected outputs.
   - **Act**: Call the method being tested (`extractLogEntries`).
   - **Assert**: Verify the results (in this case, checking if the files were created).

4. **File Existence Check**: A simple check to verify that the expected files were created. In a real-world scenario, you might want to check the content of these files as well.

This setup provides a basic structure for testing the `extractLogEntries` method in Java using JUnit. Adjustments would be needed based on the actual implementation details of the method.
