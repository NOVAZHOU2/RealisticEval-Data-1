Here is the Java code signature based on your Python code signature, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Extracts log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and saves each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param logFilePath The path to the log file.
 */
public void extractLogEntries(String logFilePath) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method `extractLogEntries` takes a single parameter `logFilePath` of type `String`, which represents the path to the log file. The method does not return any value (`void`). The comments above the method provide a description of what the method does, including the types of log levels it processes and how it handles them.
