Sure, hereâ€™s how you can translate the given Python function signature and comments into JavaScript, adhering to the JSDoc format:

### JavaScript Code

```javascript
/**
 * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param {string} logFilepath - Path to the log file.
 */
function extractLogEntries(logFilepath) {
    // Function body goes here.
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Signature**: The Python `def` statement is converted to the JavaScript `function` keyword.
2. **Parameter Naming**: The parameter `log_file_path` is renamed to `logFilepath` to follow camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript.
3. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The Python docstring is transformed into JSDoc comments.
   - The `@param` tag is used to describe the parameter `logFilepath`.
   - The description of the function's purpose is included within the JSDoc comment block.
