Sure, here is the JavaScript version of the Python function signature with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
 * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
 *
 * @param {string} logFilePath - Path to the log file.
 */
```

And here is how you might define the function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function extractLogEntries(logFilePath) {
    /**
     * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
     * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
     *
     * @param {string} logFilePath - Path to the log file.
     */
}
```
