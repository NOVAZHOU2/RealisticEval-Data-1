Here's how you can convert the given Python function to JavaScript:

```javascript
function extractLogEntries(logFilePath) {
    /**
     * Extract log entries from a log file for WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and ALERT levels
     * and save each type of log entry to a different file.
     *
     * @param {string} logFilePath - Path to the log file.
     */

    // Your implementation goes here...
}
```

In JavaScript, we use `function` keyword to define a function, and we don't need to specify types for arguments or return values like in TypeScript or other languages that support type annotations. The comment is also written using JSDoc style, which is commonly used in JavaScript for documentation purposes.
