Here's how you can convert your Python function signature to Java:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    /**
     * Determines if the point (x, y) is inside the given polygon.
     * The polygon is defined as a list of tuples (x, y) representing the vertices.
     *
     * @param point  A tuple (x, y) representing the point to check.
     * @param polygon A list of tuples (x, y) representing the vertices of the polygon.
     * @return boolean: True if the point is inside the polygon, False otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean isPointInPolygon(Tuple point, List<Tuple> polygon) {
        // Your implementation here...
    }
}

class Tuple {
    double x;
    double y;

    public Tuple(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    // Getters and setters...
}
```

Please note that in Java, there is no direct equivalent to Python's `tuple` data type. Therefore, I've used a custom `Tuple` class to represent points with `x` and `y` coordinates. You would need to implement appropriate getters and setters for the `Tuple` class depending on your needs.
