Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function isPointInPolygon(point: Point, polygon: Point[]): boolean {
  /**
   * Determine if the point (x, y) is inside the given polygon.
   * The polygon is defined as an array of objects {x, y} representing the vertices.
   
   * @param point - An object {x, y} representing the point to check.
   * @param polygon - An array of objects {x, y} representing the vertices of the polygon.
   
   * @returns true if the point is inside the polygon, false otherwise.
   */
}
```

This TypeScript version maintains the same functionality and structure as your original Python function, but with type annotations for better clarity and type safety in JavaScript/TypeScript environments.
