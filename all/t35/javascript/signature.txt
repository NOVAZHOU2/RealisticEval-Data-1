Sure, here's how you can translate that Python function signature into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Determine if the point (x, y) is inside the given polygon.
 * The polygon is defined as an array of arrays [x, y] representing the vertices.
 *
 * @param {Array} point - An array [x, y] representing the point to check.
 * @param {Array<Array>} polygon - An array of arrays [x, y] representing the vertices of the polygon.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the point is inside the polygon, false otherwise.
 */
function isPointInPolygon(point, polygon) {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Type Annotations**: In JavaScript, type annotations are not enforced at runtime, but they can be used with tools like JSDoc for documentation purposes.
- **Function Parameters**:
  - `point`: An array `[x, y]` representing the point to check.
  - `polygon`: An array of arrays `[x, y]`, where each inner array represents a vertex of the polygon.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a boolean indicating whether the point is inside the polygon or not.

You would need to implement the logic inside the `isPointInPolygon` function in JavaScript based on your specific requirements.
