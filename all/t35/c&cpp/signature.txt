Here's how you can convert your Python function into C++ with appropriate comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility> // for std::pair

/**
 * Determines if the point (x, y) is inside the given polygon.
 * The polygon is defined as a vector of pairs (x, y) representing the vertices.
 *
 * @param point: A pair<int, int> representing the point to check.
 * @param polygon: A vector of pairs<int, int> representing the vertices of the polygon.
 *
 * @return: True if the point is inside the polygon, False otherwise.
 */
bool isPointInPolygon(const std::pair<int, int>& point, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& polygon) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Note that in C++, we use `std::pair` instead of tuples and `std::vector` instead of lists. Also, the function name has been changed to follow C++ naming conventions. Please fill in the actual logic of the function based on your needs.
