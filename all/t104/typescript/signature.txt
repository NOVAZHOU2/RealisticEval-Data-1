Hereâ€™s how to change the JavaScript function signature to TypeScript while keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * The incoming thread object is converted into a JSON file, which is represented as a Blob object.
 * 
 * @param {Object} thread - The thread object to be converted.
 */
function convertThreadToJSONFile(thread: object): void {
    
}
```

### Changes made:
1. Added a type annotation for the `thread` parameter: `thread: object`.
2. Specified the return type of the function as `void` (since the function currently does not return anything). 

Feel free to adjust the type of `thread` to be more specific if you have a defined interface or type for it.
