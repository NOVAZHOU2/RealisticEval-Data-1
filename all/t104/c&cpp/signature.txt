Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * The incoming thread object is converted into a JSON file, which is represented as a string.
 * 
 * @param thread - The thread object to be converted.
 */
void convertThreadToJSONFile(const nlohmann::json& thread) {
    
}
```

This maintains the function's purpose while adapting to C++ syntax. Would you like to delve into further details?
