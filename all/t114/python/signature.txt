To convert the given JavaScript function signature into Python, we will follow the same documentation style but use Python syntax and conventions. Here's how the JavaScript code can be translated into Python:
JavaScript Code
javascript
/**
 * sorts an array of objects by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} array - The array of objects to be sorted.
 * @returns {Object[]} The sorted array, based on the timestamp property.
 */
function sortByTimestamp(array) {}
Python Code
python
def sort_by_timestamp(array):
    """
    Sorts a list of dictionaries by the 'timestamp' property.

    Args:
        array (list[dict]): The list of dictionaries to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: The sorted list, based on the 'timestamp' property.
    """
    pass
Explanation of Changes
Function Definition:
The function keyword in JavaScript is replaced with def in Python.
The function name is changed to snake_case, which is the convention in Python (sortByTimestamp to sort_by_timestamp).
Parameters:
The parameter type is expressed using type hints in Python (array is of type list[dict]).
Docstring Format:
The documentation style is converted to a Python docstring, using triple quotes """ and the appropriate syntax for describing the parameters and return values.
Return Statement:
In Python, we use pass as a placeholder since the function implementation isn't provided.
This Python signature can now be filled with the logic to sort the list of dictionaries based on the timestamp property. Hereâ€™s a possible implementation:
Complete Python Implementation
python
def sort_by_timestamp(array):
    """
    Sorts a list of dictionaries by the 'timestamp' property.

    Args:
        array (list[dict]): The list of dictionaries to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: The sorted list, based on the 'timestamp' property.
    """
    return sorted(array, key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])
Explanation of Implementation
The sorted() function is used to sort the list of dictionaries.
A lambda function lambda x: x['timestamp'] is passed as the key to sort by the timestamp property of each dictionary.
