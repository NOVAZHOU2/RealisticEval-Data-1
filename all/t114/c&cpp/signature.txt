Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments converted:

```cpp
/**
 * Sorts a vector of objects by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param std::vector<MyObject> array - The vector of objects to be sorted.
 * @returns std::vector<MyObject> The sorted vector, based on the timestamp property.
 */
std::vector<MyObject> sortByTimestamp(std::vector<MyObject> array) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

Make sure to define `MyObject` according to your needs!
