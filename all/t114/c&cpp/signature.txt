Certainly! Here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments and functionality:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Define a structure for the objects with a timestamp
struct Object {
    std::string timestamp;
};

/**
 * Sorts a vector of objects by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param std::vector<Object>& objects - The vector of objects to be sorted.
 * @returns std::vector<Object> The sorted vector, based on the timestamp property.
 */
std::vector<Object> sortByTimestamp(std::vector<Object>& objects) {
    // Implementation goes here
    return objects; // Placeholder return
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<Object> objects = {
        {"2023-10-01 12:00:00"},
        {"2023-09-30 15:30:00"},
        {"2023-10-02 08:45:00"}
    };

    std::vector<Object> sortedObjects = sortByTimestamp(objects);

    // Print sorted objects
    for (const auto& obj : sortedObjects) {
        std::cout << obj.timestamp << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Struct Definition**: We define a struct `Object` with a single member `timestamp`.
2. **Function Signature**: The `sortByTimestamp` function has the same comments and signature as the JavaScript function.
3. **Example Usage**: In the `main` function, we create a vector of `Object` instances, sort them, and print the sorted timestamps.

Here is the function signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Define a structure for the objects with a timestamp
struct Object {
    std::string timestamp;
};

/**
 * Sorts a vector of objects by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param std::vector<Object>& objects - The vector of objects to be sorted.
 * @returns std::vector<Object> The sorted vector, based on the timestamp property.
 */
std::vector<Object> sortByTimestamp(std::vector<Object>& objects) {
    // Implementation goes here
    return objects; // Placeholder return
}
```

This ensures that the function signature and comments match the original JavaScript function. You can add the actual implementation inside the `sortByTimestamp` function as needed.
