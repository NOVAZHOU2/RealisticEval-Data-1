Certainly! Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature converted to TypeScript, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Sorts an array of objects by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} array - The array of objects to be sorted.
 * @returns {Object[]} The sorted array, based on the timestamp property.
 */
function sortByTimestamp(array: { timestamp: string }[]): { timestamp: string }[] {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The parameter `array` is annotated with `{ timestamp: string }[]` to specify that each object in the array has a `timestamp` property of type `string`.
- The return type is also annotated with `{ timestamp: string }[]` to indicate that the function returns an array of objects with a `timestamp` property.

This ensures that the function signature is properly typed and the comments are preserved.
