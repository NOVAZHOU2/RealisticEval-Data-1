Here's the Java code signature with comments converted from the JavaScript version:

```java
/**
 * Sorts an array of MyObject by the timestamp property.
 *
 * @param array - The array of MyObject to be sorted.
 * @return The sorted array, based on the timestamp property.
 */
public static MyObject[] sortByTimestamp(MyObject[] array) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

### Notes:
- The method signature specifies that it returns an array of `MyObject`.
- The comments have been adapted to fit Java conventions, while maintaining clarity.
