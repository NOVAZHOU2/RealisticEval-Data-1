Sure! Below is the equivalent TypeScript function for your Python code:

```typescript
function sanitizeFilename(filename: string): string {
    /**
     * Remove illegal characters from Windows file path string
     *
     * @param {string} filename - The original filename string to be sanitized.
     * @returns {string} - A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
     */
    
    // Define illegal characters in Windows filenames
    const illegalChars = /[<>:"/\\|?*]/g;
    
    // Replace illegal characters with an empty string
    return filename.replace(illegalChars, '');
}
```

This TypeScript function `sanitizeFilename` takes a string `filename` as input and returns a sanitized version of the filename by removing any characters that are illegal in Windows file paths. The regular expression `/[<>:"/\\|?*]/g` matches all illegal characters, and the `replace` method replaces them with an empty string.
