Sure, here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Removes illegal characters from a Windows file path string.
 *
 * @param filename - The original filename string to be sanitized.
 * @returns A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
 */
function sanitizeFilename(filename: string): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This function signature includes JSDoc comments to describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value, just like in the Python version.
