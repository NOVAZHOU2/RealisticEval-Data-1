Sure! Below is an example of how you might translate the given Python `unittest` test class into a Jest test case in JavaScript. Note that I'll assume you have a function `sanitizeFilename` that performs the same operation as your Python function.

### Python `unittest` Test Class
```python
import unittest
from my_module import sanitize_filename  # Adjust the import based on where your function is located

class TestSanitizeFilename(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sanitize_filename(self):
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_filename("test<file>name.txt"), "test_file_name.txt")
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_filename("valid_filename.txt"), "valid_filename.txt")
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_filename("invalid:filename<>|?*\"/\\:.txt"), "invalid_filename_____.txt")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Equivalent Jest Test Case
First, ensure you have Jest installed and set up in your project. Then, create a new test file, e.g., `testSanitizeFilename.js`, and add the following content:

```javascript
const { sanitizeFilename } = require('./myModule'); // Adjust the import based on where your function is located

describe('sanitizeFilename', () => {
  it('should replace illegal characters with underscores', () => {
    expect(sanitizeFilename("test<file>name.txt")).toBe("test_file_name.txt");
  });

  it('should return the same filename if no illegal characters are present', () => {
    expect(sanitizeFilename("valid_filename.txt")).toBe("valid_filename.txt");
  });

  it('should replace multiple illegal characters with underscores', () => {
    expect(sanitizeFilename("invalid:filename<>|?*\"/\\:.txt")).toBe("invalid_filename_____.txt");
  });
});
```

### Explanation
- **`describe`**: This block groups related tests together. In this case, all tests related to the `sanitizeFilename` function are grouped under `describe`.
- **`it`**: Each individual test case is defined using the `it` function. It takes two arguments: a description of the test and a callback function containing the actual test logic.
- **`expect`**: Jest's assertion library. It allows you to make assertions about the output of your function.

To run the tests, simply execute the command `npm test` or `yarn test` depending on your setup. If you've configured Jest correctly, it should automatically discover and run the tests in the `testSanitizeFilename.js` file.
