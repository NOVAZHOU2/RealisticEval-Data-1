Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Remove illegal characters from a Windows file path string.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The original filename string to be sanitized.
 * @returns {string} A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
 */
function sanitizeFilename(filename) {
    // Define the illegal characters for Windows filenames
    const illegalCharsPattern = /[<>:"/\\|?*\x00-\x1F]/g;

    // Replace illegal characters with an underscore
    let sanitized = filename.replace(illegalCharsPattern, '_');

    // Optionally, you can also limit the length of the filename
    // Windows has a maximum path length of 260 characters
    const maxLength = 255;
    if (sanitized.length > maxLength) {
        sanitized = sanitized.substring(0, maxLength);
    }

    return sanitized;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The JSDoc comment block at the beginning provides a clear description of the function, its parameters, and its return type.
- The function name `sanitize_filename` is converted to `sanitizeFilename` to follow camelCase naming conventions commonly used in JavaScript.
- The parameter `filename` is documented using JSDoc tags.
- The return type is also documented using JSDoc tags.
- The rest of the function logic remains the same, ensuring that the functionality is preserved.
