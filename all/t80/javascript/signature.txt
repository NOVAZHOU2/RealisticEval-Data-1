Certainly! Below is the JavaScript version of your Python function with the same docstring:

```javascript
/**
 * Remove illegal characters from Windows file path string.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The original filename string to be sanitized.
 * @returns {string} - A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
 */
function sanitizeFilename(filename) {
    // Define the set of illegal characters in Windows filenames
    const illegalChars = /[<>:"/\\|?*]/g;

    // Replace all occurrences of illegal characters with an empty string
    return filename.replace(illegalChars, '');
}
```

This JavaScript function `sanitizeFilename` takes a string `filename` as input and returns a sanitized version of the filename by removing any characters that are illegal in Windows file paths. The regular expression `/[<>:"/\\|?*]/g` matches these characters, and they are replaced with an empty string using the `replace` method.
