Sure, here's the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function:

```javascript
function sanitizeFilename(filename) {
    /**
     * Remove illegal characters from windows file path string
     *
     * @param {string} filename - The original filename string to be sanitized.
     * @return {string} - A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
     */
    
    // Define the set of illegal characters in Windows filenames
    const illegalChars = /[*?"<>|]/g;
    
    // Replace each illegal character with an empty string
    return filename.replace(illegalChars, '');
}
```

This JavaScript function `sanitizeFilename` takes a string `filename` as input and returns a new string where all occurrences of the illegal characters (`*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`) have been removed. These characters are not allowed in Windows file paths.
