Sure! Here's the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Removes illegal characters from a Windows file path string.
 *
 * @param filename The original filename string to be sanitized.
 * @return A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
 */
std::string sanitizeFilename(const std::string& filename);
```

This C++ function signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your Python function signature.
