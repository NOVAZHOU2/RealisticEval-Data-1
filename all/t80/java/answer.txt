Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python script, organized within the `org.real.temp` package and the `Answer` class:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Remove illegal characters from Windows file path string.
     *
     * @param filename The original filename string to be sanitized.
     * @return A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
     */
    public static String sanitizeFilename(String filename) {
        // Define the illegal characters for Windows filenames
        String illegalCharsPattern = "[<>:\"/\\\\|?*\\x00-\\x1F]";

        // Replace illegal characters with an underscore
        String sanitized = filename.replaceAll(illegalCharsPattern, "_");

        // Optionally, you can also limit the length of the filename
        // Windows has a maximum path length of 260 characters
        int maxLength = 255;
        if (sanitized.length() > maxLength) {
            sanitized = sanitized.substring(0, maxLength);
        }

        return sanitized;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        String originalFilename = "example<file>.txt";
        String sanitizedFilename = sanitizeFilename(originalFilename);
        System.out.println("Original: " + originalFilename);
        System.out.println("Sanitized: " + sanitizedFilename);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
2. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined within the package.
3. **Method Signature**: The `sanitizeFilename` method takes a `String` parameter `filename` and returns a `String`.
4. **Regular Expression**: The regular expression pattern `"[<>:\"/\\\\|?*\\x00-\\x1F]"` is used to match illegal characters in Windows filenames.
5. **String Replacement**: The `replaceAll` method is used to replace all occurrences of illegal characters with an underscore `_`.
6. **Length Limitation**: If the sanitized filename exceeds 255 characters, it is truncated to 255 characters.
7. **Main Method**: An example usage is provided in the `main` method to demonstrate how the `sanitizeFilename` method works.

This Java code maintains the same functionality and logic as the provided Python code.
