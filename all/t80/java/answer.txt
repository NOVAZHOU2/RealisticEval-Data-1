Here's how you can translate your Python function into Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Remove illegal characters from windows file path string
     *
     * @param filename The original filename string to be sanitized.
     * @return A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
     */
    public static String sanitizeFilename(String filename) {
        // Add your sanitization logic here.
        // For example, removing invalid characters like \/:*?"<>|
        return filename.replaceAll("[\\\\/*?\"<>|]", "");
    }

}
```

In this Java version of your function, I've used the `replaceAll` method of the `String` class to replace all occurrences of the illegal characters with an empty string. This effectively removes them.
