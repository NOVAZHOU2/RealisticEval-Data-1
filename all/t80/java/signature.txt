Sure! Here's the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Removes illegal characters from a Windows file path string.
 *
 * @param filename The original filename string to be sanitized.
 * @return A sanitized string that is safe to use as a Windows filename.
 */
public static String sanitizeFilename(String filename) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as the Python function you provided.
