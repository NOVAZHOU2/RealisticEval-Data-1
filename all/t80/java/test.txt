Sure! Below is the equivalent Java JUnit test case for the provided Python unittest test class. Note that I'll assume you want to test a method `sanitizeFilename` in a class named `Tester`. If you have additional methods or logic, please provide them so I can include them in the test case.

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class TesterTest {

    @Test
    public void testSanitizeFilename() {
        // Create an instance of the Tester class
        Tester tester = new Tester();

        // Test data and expected results
        String[] filenames = {
            "valid_filename.txt",
            "invalid/filename\\with/illegal*characters?.txt",
            "another invalid:filename|with\\more-illegal&chars.txt"
        };

        String[] expectedResults = {
            "valid_filename.txt",
            "invalidfilename_with_illegal_characters_txt",
            "another_invalid_filename_with_more_illegal_chars_txt"
        };

        // Loop through each test case and verify the output
        for (int i = 0; i < filenames.length; i++) {
            String result = tester.sanitizeFilename(filenames[i]);
            assertEquals(expectedResults[i], result);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The package declaration is set to `org.real.temp`.
2. **Class Declaration**: The test class is named `TesterTest`, which follows the convention of appending `Test` to the name of the class being tested (`Tester`).
3. **Test Method**: The test method is named `testSanitizeFilename` and uses the `@Test` annotation to indicate it's a test method.
4. **Instance Creation**: An instance of the `Tester` class is created to call the `sanitizeFilename` method.
5. **Test Data and Expected Results**: Arrays are used to store the test data and their corresponding expected results.
6. **Loop Through Test Cases**: A loop iterates through each test case, calls the `sanitizeFilename` method, and asserts that the result matches the expected value using `assertEquals`.

Make sure you have the necessary imports and that your `Tester` class has a `sanitizeFilename` method that performs the same functionality as the Python function. Here is a simple example of what the `Tester` class might look like:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Tester {
    public String sanitizeFilename(String filename) {
        // Implement the sanitization logic here
        return filename.replaceAll("[\\\\/*?\"<>|]", "_");
    }
}
```

This Java class includes a method `sanitizeFilename` that removes illegal characters from a Windows file path string, similar to the Python function. Adjust the regular expression as needed based on your specific requirements.
