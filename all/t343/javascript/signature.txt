Hereâ€™s the JavaScript version with the code comments preserved and the TypeScript signatures removed:

```javascript
/**
 * Compares two objects to determine if they have the same depth and structure.
 *
 * @param obj1 - The first object to compare.
 * @param obj2 - The second object to compare.
 * @returns True if the objects have equal depth, otherwise false.
 */
function compareObjectsDepth(obj1, obj2) {
}
```

This keeps your comments intact while adapting the function signature to JavaScript.
