Here's how you can convert the provided TypeScript code to Python. The structure and functionality of the code have been preserved in the translation:
python
from typing import Any, Dict

def compare_objects_depth(obj1: Dict[str, Any], obj2: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """
    Compares two objects to determine if they have the same depth and structure.

    Args:
        obj1: The first object to compare.
        obj2: The second object to compare.

    Returns:
        True if the objects have equal depth, otherwise False.
    """
    # Check if both are dictionaries
    if not isinstance(obj1, dict) or not isinstance(obj2, dict):
        return False

    # Get the keys of both dictionaries
    keys1 = obj1.keys()
    keys2 = obj2.keys()

    # Check if the number of keys is the same
    if len(keys1) != len(keys2):
        return False

    # Compare each key
    for key in keys1:
        # Check if key exists in both dictionaries
        if key not in keys2:
            return False
        
        # Recursively check the depth of the properties
        is_equal_depth = compare_objects_depth(obj1[key], obj2[key])
        if not is_equal_depth:
            return False

    return True
Explanation of the Code:
Type Annotations:
Dict[str, Any] is used to represent the AnyObject type, which is a dictionary with string keys and values of any type.
Function Definition:
The function is defined as compare_objects_depth, following Python's naming conventions.
Docstring:
The docstring describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return type, similar to the TypeScript comments.
Type Checking:
The isinstance function is used to check if both obj1 and obj2 are dictionaries. In Python, the dict type is the equivalent of JavaScript objects.
Key Comparison:
The keys of both dictionaries are obtained using the .keys() method. Length comparison is done using len().
Iterating Over Keys:
The loop iterates through the keys of obj1, checking for the existence of each key in obj2 and recursively calling compare_objects_depth to check nested objects.
Return Value:
The function returns True if all checks are passed and False otherwise, ensuring that the objects have the same structure and depth.
This Python code maintains the same logic as the original TypeScript code, adapting it to fit Python's syntax and conventions.
