To convert the provided TypeScript code signature to Python, we will define a similar structure using Python's type hints. Python does not have a direct equivalent of TypeScript's AnyObject, but we can use dict with str keys and Any values from the typing module. Below is the equivalent Python code signature, maintaining the comments from the TypeScript version.
python
from typing import Any, Dict

# Define a type for AnyObject as a dictionary with string keys and values of any type
AnyObject = Dict[str, Any]

def compare_objects_depth(obj1: AnyObject, obj2: AnyObject) -> bool:
    """ 
    Compares two objects to determine if they have the same depth and structure.
    
    Args:
        obj1: The first object to compare.
        obj2: The second object to compare.
        
    Returns:
        True if the objects have equal depth, otherwise false.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Type Definition: AnyObject is defined as a dictionary with str keys and Any values, which allows it to hold any type of data.
Function Signature: The function compare_objects_depth takes two AnyObject arguments and returns a boolean.
Docstring: The comments explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return type are preserved in a docstring format, which is the convention in Python.
You can replace pass with the actual implementation of the function as needed.
