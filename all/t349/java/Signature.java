/**
 * Generates all possible combinations of elements from a list of lists, where each combination consists of

 * product variations, scenarios in decision-making tools, or any other context where all possible combinations
 * of a set of options need to be explored.
 *
 * @param inputLists A list of lists containing the elements to combine. The lists must not be null but can contain any type of elements.
 * @return A list of lists, where each list represents a possible combination of elements taken from the input lists.
 *         Returns an empty list if the input list is null or empty.
