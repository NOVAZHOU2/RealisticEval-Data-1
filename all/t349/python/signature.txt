To convert the Java method signature into a Python function signature, we will maintain the functionality described in the comments. Here's how the function signature would look in Python:
Java Method Signature
java
public List<List<T>> generateCombinations(List<List<T>> inputLists) {}
Corresponding Python Function Signature
python
def generate_combinations(self, input_lists: List[List[T]]) -> List[List[T]]:
Explanation of the Changes
Method vs. Function: In Python, we use the def keyword to define a function, and the function typically belongs to a class if we include self as the first parameter.
Naming Convention: The Java method name generateCombinations has been converted to generate_combinations to follow Python’s PEP 8 naming conventions.
Type Hints: The type hints for the input parameter and the return type are maintained:
input_lists: List[List[T]] indicates that the input is a list of lists of some type T.
-> List[List[T]] indicates that the function will return a list of lists of the same type T.
Complete Function Signature in Context
Here’s how it would fit in a class context:
python
from typing import List, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

class Answer:
    def generate_combinations(self, input_lists: List[List[T]]) -> List[List[T]]:
        pass  # Implementation would go here
This Python signature effectively captures the same functionality as the original Java method signature. You can implement the body of the function as needed while keeping the same input/output structure.
