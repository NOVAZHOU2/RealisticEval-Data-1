Here’s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function changedClef into a Python function. The Python code will achieve the same functionality of modifying the ABC notation string by inserting the specified clef after the tone line (K:).
Here’s the Python version of the function:
python
def changed_clef(abc: str, clef: str = "bass") -> str:
    # Find the index of the key signature line
    clef_index = abc.find("\nK:")
    
    # If the key signature is found
    if clef_index != -1:
        # Find the next newline character after the key signature line,
        # or if none exists, use the end of the string
        next_newline = abc.find("\n", clef_index + 1)
        if next_newline == -1:
            next_newline = len(abc)
        
        # Create the string to inject, which includes the clef
        injection = f" clef={clef}"
        
        # Construct the new ABC string with the injected clef
        return f"{abc[:next_newline]}{injection}{abc[next_newline:]}"
    
    # If the key signature is not found, return the original string
    return abc
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Definition:
The function changed_clef is defined with two parameters: abc, a string, and clef, which defaults to "bass".
Finding the Key Signature:
The find method is used instead of indexOf to locate the position of \nK: in the abc string.
Next Newline Handling:
Similar to JavaScript, the next newline is found using the find method. If no newline is found, the length of the string is used.
Injection String:
The clef string is constructed using an f-string for clarity.
String Construction:
The new ABC string is constructed by concatenating the parts of the original string with the injected clef.
Return Statement:
If the key signature is not found, the function returns the original ABC string.
Usage Example:
Here's how you could use the function:
python
abc_string = """X: 1
T: Example Tune
K: C
E D C B A
"""

new_abc = changed_clef(abc_string, "clef=bass")
print(new_abc)
This will insert the clef string after the key signature line.
