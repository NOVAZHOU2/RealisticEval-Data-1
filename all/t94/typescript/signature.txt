Here's the TypeScript code signature with the comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.
 *
 * @param {string} startingNote - The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
 * @returns {string[]} An array representing the Circle of Fifths.
 */
function createCircleOfFifths(startingNote: string): string[] {

}
```

This change adds type annotations for the parameter and the return type. Let me know if you want to delve further into this!
