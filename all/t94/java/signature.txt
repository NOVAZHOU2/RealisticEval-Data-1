Certainly! Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved, matching the JavaScript code signature:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.
 *
 * @param startingNote The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
 * @return A list representing the Circle of Fifths.
 */
public static List<String> createCircleOfFifths(String startingNote) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comments**: The comments are preserved exactly as in the JavaScript code.
2. **Method Signature**: The method `createCircleOfFifths` is defined as `public static List<String> createCircleOfFifths(String startingNote)` to match the JavaScript function signature.
3. **Return Type**: The method returns a `List<String>` instead of an array, which is a common practice in Java for dynamic collections.

This code signature can be used as a template for implementing the method in Java.
