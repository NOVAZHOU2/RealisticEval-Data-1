Hereâ€™s how you can convert the JavaScript function signature and comments into Java code:

```java
/**
 * Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.
 *
 * @param startingNote The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
 * @return A List representing the Circle of Fifths.
 */
public static List<String> createCircleOfFifths(String startingNote) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Notes:
- The return type is changed from `string[]` to `List<String>`, which is the equivalent in Java.
- The comments are preserved as you requested.
