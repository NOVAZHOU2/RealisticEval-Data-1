Certainly! Here's the equivalent C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.
 *
 * @param startingNote The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
 * @returns A vector representing the Circle of Fifths.
 */
std::vector<std::string> createCircleOfFifths(const std::string& startingNote) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comments:**
   - The comments are preserved exactly as in the JavaScript code.

2. **Function Signature:**
   - The function `createCircleOfFifths` is declared to take a `const std::string& startingNote` as its parameter.
   - It returns a `std::vector<std::string>` which represents the Circle of Fifths.

This ensures that the function signature and comments match the original JavaScript code. You can add the implementation details inside the function body as needed.
