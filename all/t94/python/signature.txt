To convert the JavaScript code signature to a Python code signature, we'll need to:
Change the function declaration to Python syntax.
Change the type annotations (from JavaScript-style @param and @returns comments) to Python's typing module.
Ensure the function signature in Python is similar in meaning and purpose.
Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python function signature:
python
from typing import List

def create_circle_of_fifths(starting_note: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.

    :param starting_note: The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
    :return: A list representing the Circle of Fifths.
    """
    pass
Explanation:
Function Name: In Python, function names are typically written in snake_case. So, I changed createCircleOfFifths to create_circle_of_fifths.
Type Annotations:
In Python, the argument type annotation for startingNote is str (equivalent to the JavaScript string).
The return type annotation is List[str] (equivalent to JavaScript's string[]).
Docstring: In Python, documentation is added using docstrings. This replaces the JavaScript @param and @returns annotations with Python-style docstrings. The purpose is the same, just formatted for Python.
You can now proceed with the function body as needed, with this signature as the base.
