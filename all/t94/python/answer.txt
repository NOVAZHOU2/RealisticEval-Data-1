To convert the provided JavaScript code into Python, we will create a similar function that generates a Circle of Fifths. Since the JavaScript code uses the Tonal.js library for musical note transposition, we will implement the necessary functionality in Python.
JavaScript Code
javascript
const { Note, Interval } = require('@tonaljs/tonal');

/**
 * generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note
 * @param {string} startingNote - The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").
 * @returns {string[]} An array representing the Circle of Fifths.
 */
function createCircleOfFifths(startingNote) {
    let currentNote = startingNote;  // Initialize with the starting note
    const circle = [currentNote];    // Start the circle with the initial note

    // Loop to generate the next 11 notes in the circle
    for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
        // Transpose the current note up by a perfect fifth (P5)
        currentNote = Note.transpose(currentNote, Interval.get("P5"));
        circle.push(currentNote);  // Add the transposed note to the circle
    }
    
    return circle;  // Return the full Circle of Fifths
}
Converted Python Code
To achieve the equivalent functionality in Python, we can create a simple function without needing an external library. Here is the Python code:
python
# Circle of Fifths in Python

def create_circle_of_fifths(starting_note: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Generates a cyclic tone sequence of five degrees of length 12 starting with the specified starting note.

    Args:
        starting_note (str): The musical note to start the Circle of Fifths from (e.g., "C").

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list representing the Circle of Fifths.
    """
    
    # Define the perfect fifth intervals in terms of note names
    fifths = ['C', 'G', 'D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'F#', 'C#', 'G#', 'D#', 'A#', 'F']
    
    # Create a mapping of note names to indices for easier manipulation
    note_index = {note: i for i, note in enumerate(fifths)}
    
    # Start with the given note
    if starting_note not in note_index:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid starting note: {starting_note}")

    current_index = note_index[starting_note]
    circle = [starting_note]  # Start the circle with the initial note

    # Generate the next 11 notes in the Circle of Fifths
    for _ in range(11):
        current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(fifths)  # Move to the next index (perfect fifth)
        circle.append(fifths[current_index])  # Add the transposed note to the circle

    return circle  # Return the full Circle of Fifths


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    starting_note = "C"
    circle_of_fifths = create_circle_of_fifths(starting_note)
    print(circle_of_fifths)
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition:
The function create_circle_of_fifths takes a starting_note as input and returns a list of strings representing the Circle of Fifths.
Perfect Fifth Intervals:
A list named fifths is created to represent the cycle of fifths starting from "C".
Note Index Mapping:
A dictionary note_index maps each note name to its index in the fifths list for easy access.
Input Validation:
The function checks if the starting_note is valid by verifying its presence in note_index.
Generating the Circle:
A loop iterates 11 times, updating the current note by moving to the next index in the fifths list and appending the note to the circle list.
Return:
Finally, the complete list representing the Circle of Fifths is returned.
Example Usage:
The if __name__ == "__main__": block allows you to run the function and see the output when the script is executed directly. You can change starting_note to any valid note in the circle (like "C", "G", etc.) to see different results.
