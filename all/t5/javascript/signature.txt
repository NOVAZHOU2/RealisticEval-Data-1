Sure! Here is the JavaScript code signature with the same comments and structure:

```javascript
/**
 * Implementing matrix multiplication
 *
 * @param {number[][]} matrixA - Matrix A
 * @param {number[][]} matrixB - Matrix B
 * @returns {number[][]} The result of multiplying matrixA and matrixB
 */
function matrixMultiply(matrixA, matrixB) {
```

This JavaScript function `matrixMultiply` takes two parameters, `matrixA` and `matrixB`, both of which are arrays of arrays of numbers, and returns an array of arrays representing the product of the two matrices. The comment above the function describes what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
