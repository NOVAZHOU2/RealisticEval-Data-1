Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code with the same method signature and comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Implementing matrix multiplication
 *
 * @param matrixA matrix A
 * @param matrixB matrix B
 * @return matrixA * matrixB multiplication result
 */
public static List<List<Integer>> matrixMultiply(List<List<Integer>> matrixA, List<List<Integer>> matrixB) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, you would typically use nested loops or other data structures like `ArrayList` to handle matrices, and you would need to implement the actual logic for matrix multiplication inside the method. The above code snippet only contains the method signature and docstring, which you can expand upon based on your specific requirements.
