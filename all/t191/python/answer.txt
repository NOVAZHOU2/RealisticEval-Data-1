Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided C++ code to Python. The Python code will implement the same logic to convert a floating-point number to its hexadecimal representation.
Converted Python Code
python
import struct

def float_to_hex(value: float) -> str:
    """
    Converts a float to its hexadecimal string representation.
    
    :param value: The float value to convert.
    :return: The hexadecimal representation of the float as a string.
    """
    # Interpret the float's bit pattern as an unsigned integer
    int_representation = struct.unpack('!I', struct.pack('!f', value))[0]
    
    # Convert the unsigned integer to a hexadecimal string
    hex_string = f"{int_representation:08x}"
    
    return hex_string

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_float = 3.14159
    hex_result = float_to_hex(example_float)
    print(f"Hexadecimal representation of {example_float}: {hex_result}")
Explanation of the Code:
Imports:
The struct module is imported, which allows us to convert between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes.
Function Definition:
The function float_to_hex takes a float value as an input and returns its hexadecimal string representation.
Bit Pattern Representation:
The struct.pack('!f', value) converts the float to a byte representation.
The struct.unpack('!I', ...) converts the byte representation to an unsigned integer. The ! indicates network (big-endian) byte order.
Hexadecimal Conversion:
The f"{int_representation:08x}" formats the integer as a hexadecimal string, ensuring it is zero-padded to 8 characters.
Example Usage:
An example usage block is provided to demonstrate how to call the function and print the result.
Running the Code:
You can save this code in a file named float_to_hex.py and run it with the following command:
bash
python float_to_hex.py
This will display the hexadecimal representation of the example float value (3.14159). You can change the example_float variable to test with other floating-point numbers.
