Hereâ€™s the conversion of the provided C++ code signature to a Python code signature, while retaining the comments and converting them to Python-style comments:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def float_to_hex(value: float) -> str:
    """
    Converts a floating-point number to its hexadecimal representation.

    :param value: The float value to be converted to hexadecimal.
    :return: A string containing the hexadecimal representation of the
             input float.

    :note: The output string will be in lowercase hexadecimal format.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Changes:
Function Name:
The function name is changed from floatToHex to float_to_hex to adhere to Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
Parameter and Return Types:
The parameter value remains the same, but the type hint is added as float, and the return type is specified as str.
Comment Conversion:
The C++ style comments are converted to Python docstrings using triple quotes """.
The formatting is kept similar, maintaining clarity and structure.
Function Body:
The function body is defined with pass, indicating that the implementation will be added later.
Usage:
You can use this function signature in your Python code and implement the logic as needed. The function can be part of a module, and you can later fill in the body to provide the actual functionality for converting a float to its hexadecimal representation.
