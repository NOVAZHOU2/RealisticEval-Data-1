Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java function signature for the provided C++ code, including the appropriate Javadoc comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts a floating-point number to its hexadecimal representation.
 *
 * @param value The float value to be converted to hexadecimal.
 * @return A String containing the hexadecimal representation of the
 *         input float.
 *
 * @note The output string will be in lowercase hexadecimal format.
 */
public static String floatToHex(float value) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Javadoc Comments**: The comments from C++ are converted into Javadoc format, preserving the structure and details.
2. **Return Type**: `std::string` is replaced with `String`, which is the Java equivalent.
3. **Method Modifier**: The `public static` modifiers are included to indicate that this method can be called without instantiating the class, similar to the C++ function signature.
4. **Body**: The body of the method is left empty (with a comment) since the implementation is not provided. You can fill it in based on your requirements.
