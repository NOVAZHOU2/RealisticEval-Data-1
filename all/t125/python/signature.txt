To convert the provided JavaScript function signature and documentation to Python, we need to follow Python's conventions for docstrings and function definitions. Hereâ€™s how the equivalent code signature would look in Python:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/** 
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace without disrupting 
 * the integrity of content within <pre>, <div>, <script>, and <style> tags. 
 * For example: 
 *      input: '   <div>   Content  </div>   ' 
 *      output: '<div> Content </div>' 
 * 
 * @param {string} htmlString - The HTML content to compress. 
 * @returns {string} The compressed HTML content. */
function compressHTML(htmlString) {}
Python Code Signature
python
def compress_html(html_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace without disrupting
    the integrity of content within <pre>, <div>, <script>, and <style> tags.
    
    For example:
        input: '   <div>   Content  </div>   '
        output: '<div> Content </div>'
    
    Args:
        html_string (str): The HTML content to compress.
    
    Returns:
        str: The compressed HTML content.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of the Python Code Signature:
Function Definition: The function is defined using def, followed by the function name compress_html, adhering to Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations:
html_string: str specifies that the parameter html_string should be of type str.
-> str indicates that the function will return a string.
Docstring: The docstring is formatted using triple quotes """, and includes:
A brief description of what the function does.
An example demonstrating the input and output.
Args: Section describing the parameters with their types.
Returns: Section indicating the return type of the function.
Placeholder for Implementation: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for where the implementation of the function would go.
This Python signature and documentation are designed to be clear and informative, following best practices for writing Python functions and their associated documentation.
