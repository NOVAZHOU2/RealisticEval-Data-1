Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code signature with comments based on your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * Compresses an HTML string by removing unnecessary whitespace without disrupting
 * the integrity of content within <pre>, <div>, <script>, and <style> tags.
 * For example:
 *      input: '   <div>   Content  </div>   '
 *      output: '<div> Content </div>'
 *
 * @param htmlString The HTML content to compress.
 * @return The compressed HTML content.
 */
public static String compressHTML(String htmlString) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The JavaDoc comments are structured similarly to the JavaScript documentation.
- The parameter and return types are adjusted to fit Java conventions.
- The method is defined as `public static`, which is common for utility functions in Java.
