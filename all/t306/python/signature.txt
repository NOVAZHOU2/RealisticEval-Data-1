To convert the JavaScript function signature and comments to a Python function signature with a docstring, you can follow the structure of Python's type hints and documentation style. Hereâ€™s how you can rewrite it:
python
def get_price(recipe_id: str, min_val: float = 10, max_val: float = 30) -> float:
    """
    The recipe ID is hashed to produce a price in the specified range.

    :param recipe_id: The ID of the recipe to hash.
    :param min_val: The minimum value of the price range (default is 10).
    :param max_val: The maximum value of the price range (default is 30).
    :returns: The hashed price, mapped to the specified range with two decimal places.
    """
    pass  # Replace with function implementation
Explanation:
Function Name: The function name get_price follows Python naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameters:
recipe_id: The ID of the recipe to hash, typed as str.
min_val: The minimum value of the price range, typed as float, with a default value of 10.
max_val: The maximum value of the price range, typed as float, with a default value of 30.
Return Type: The function returns a float, indicating the price.
Docstring: The docstring provides a description of the function, detailing the parameters and return value, following Python conventions for documentation.
You can implement the function logic within the pass statement as needed.
