To convert your Python `unittest` test class into a C++ `Catch2` test case, you'll need to create a new file with a `.cpp` extension and include the Catch2 library. Below is an example of how you can do this.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed in your project. If you're using a build system like CMake, you can add it as a subdirectory:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/catch2)
```

Then, create a new `.cpp` file for your tests, e.g., `test_rgb_to_hsv.cpp`. Here's how you might translate your Python `unittest` test class into a C++ `Catch2` test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include "rgb_to_hsv.h" // Assuming your function is defined in this header

TEST_CASE("RGB to HSV Conversion", "[rgb_to_hsv]") {
    REQUIRE(rgb_to_hsv(0, 0, 255) == std::make_tuple(240, 100, 100));
    // Add more test cases here
}
```

In this example, we've created a test case named "RGB to HSV Conversion" that checks if the `rgb_to_hsv` function returns the correct HSV values for a given RGB input. The `REQUIRE` macro from Catch2 asserts that the condition is true; if not, the test will fail.

Remember to replace `"rgb_to_hsv.h"` with the actual path to the header file where your `rgb_to_hsv` function is declared.

If you have multiple test cases, you can simply add more `REQUIRE` statements within the same `TEST_CASE` block or create additional `TEST_CASE`s as needed.
