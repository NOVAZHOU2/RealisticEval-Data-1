To convert the JavaScript function signature and its accompanying documentation comment to a Python function signature with a docstring, you can follow the structure below. Hereâ€™s how the provided JavaScript code translates into Python:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
import json

def save_as_json(data: dict, output_file_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Converts the data object to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.

    Args:
        data (dict): The data object to be converted to JSON.
        output_file_path (str): The file path where the JSON will be saved.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Breakdown of the Conversion:
Imports:
The import statement for the json module is included at the top, similar to the fs module in JavaScript.
Function Definition:
The function is defined using the def keyword in Python, following the format:
python
def function_name(parameters) -> return_type:
The save_as_json function takes two parameters:
data: dict: The type hint specifies that data should be a dictionary.
output_file_path: str: The type hint specifies that output_file_path should be a string.
Docstring:
A docstring follows the function definition, explaining the purpose of the function and describing its parameters. This mirrors the JSDoc comment in the original JavaScript code:
The Args: section describes each parameter and its expected type.
The docstring format is standard in Python for documentation.
Function Implementation Placeholder:
The pass statement serves as a placeholder, indicating where the function implementation will go.
This Python function signature effectively captures the intent of the original JavaScript function, maintaining clear parameter types and documentation. You can implement the function logic within the pass statement later as needed.
