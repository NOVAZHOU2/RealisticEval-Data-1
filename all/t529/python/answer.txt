Here is the equivalent Python code using the built-in `json` module:

```python
import json

def save_as_json(data, output_file_path):
    """
    Converts the data dictionary to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.

    :param dict data: The data dictionary to be converted to JSON.
    :param str output_file_path: The file path where the JSON will be saved.
    """
```

This Python function works similarly to your JavaScript function. It takes a dictionary (which corresponds to an object in JavaScript) and a string representing a file path, then writes the dictionary's JSON representation to that file. 

Please note that unlike Node.js which has asynchronous file I/O operations, Python's standard library does not provide such functionality out of the box. Therefore, if you need to perform file writing operations asynchronously, you may want to use libraries like `aiofiles`.
