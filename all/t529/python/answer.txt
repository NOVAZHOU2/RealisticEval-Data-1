Sure! Here's how you can convert the JavaScript code to Python:

```python
import json

def save_as_json(data, output_file_path):
    """
    Converts the data object to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.

    :param data: The data object to be converted to JSON.
    :param output_file_path: The file path where the JSON will be saved.
    """
    with open(output_file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
```

This Python function `save_as_json` does the same thing as your JavaScript function `saveAsJSON`. It takes a data object and an output file path, converts the data object to JSON format, and writes it to the specified file. The `indent=4` parameter in `json.dump` makes the output more readable by adding indentation to the JSON structure.
