Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the provided JavaScript function, including the comments:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

/**
 * Converts the data object to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.
 * @param data - The data object to be converted to JSON.
 * @param outputFilePath - The file path where the JSON will be saved.
 */
void saveAsJSON(const nlohmann::json& data, const std::string& outputFilePath);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Headers**: 
   - `#include <fstream>`: For file operations.
   - `#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>`: For handling JSON data (assuming you're using the popular JSON library).

2. **Function Signature**:
   - `void saveAsJSON(const nlohmann::json& data, const std::string& outputFilePath);`: This declares a function named `saveAsJSON` that takes a constant reference to a `nlohmann::json` object and a constant string representing the output file path.

3. **Comments**:
   - The comment above the function describes what the function does, which matches the original JavaScript comment.

This C++ function signature assumes you are using the `nlohmann/json` library for JSON serialization. If you are using a different JSON library, you would need to adjust the include directive accordingly.
