Here's the TypeScript version of your code signature, with the comments preserved:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';

/**
 * Converts the data object to JSON format and saves it to the specified file path.
 * @param {Object} data - The data object to be converted to JSON.
 * @param {string} outputFilePath - The file path where the JSON will be saved.
 */
function saveAsJSON(data: object, outputFilePath: string): void {
}
```

This version uses type annotations for the parameters and the return type, while keeping your comments intact.
