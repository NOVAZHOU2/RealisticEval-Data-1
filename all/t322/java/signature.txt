Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments converted from the provided JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Verify that a string is a valid email address.
 *
 * @param email The email address to be validated.
 * @return Returns true if the email matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid,
 *         or false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments while adapting it to Java syntax.
