Here's the equivalent C++ code signature with comments, matching the provided JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * verify that a string is a valid email address
 *
 * @param email - The email address to be validated.
 * @returns true if the email matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid,
 *          or false otherwise.
 */
bool isValidEmail(const std::string& email) {
}
```

This signature maintains the structure and comments from the JavaScript version.
