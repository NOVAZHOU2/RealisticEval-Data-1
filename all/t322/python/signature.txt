Certainly! Below is the Python version of your JavaScript code signature with the same comments:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    """
    Verify that a string is a valid email address.

    :param str email: The email address to be validated.
    :return: True if the email matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid; False otherwise.
    :rtype: bool
    """
```

This Python function `is_valid_email` takes a single parameter `email`, which is expected to be a string. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the email address is valid according to the specified regular expression pattern.
