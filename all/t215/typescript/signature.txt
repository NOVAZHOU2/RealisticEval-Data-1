Here is how you can convert your Python function signature into TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads a text file, replaces words according to a dictionary map, and returns the modified text.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the text file.
 * @param replacementDict - A dictionary where the keys are words to be replaced, and the values are the replacement words.
 * @returns The text with the words replaced.
 */
async function replaceWordsInFile(filePath: string, replacementDict: { [key: string]: string }): Promise<string> {
```

This TypeScript version of the function signature includes type annotations for `filePath` and `replacementDict`, and it also specifies that the function is asynchronous and returns a promise of type `string`. This reflects the asynchronous nature of reading files in Node.js or similar environments, which often require using promises or async/await syntax.
