Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space.
 *
 * @param point1 The first point as an array of coordinates [x1, y1].
 * @param point2 The second point as an array of coordinates [x2, y2].
 * @return The Euclidean distance between the two points.
 */
public static double calculateEuclideanDistance(double[] point1, double[] point2) {
```

In Java, arrays are used instead of tuples for simplicity and clarity. The method is declared as `static` so it can be called without creating an instance of the class.
