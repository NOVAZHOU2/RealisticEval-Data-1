Here is how you would translate that Python function signature into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} point1 - The first point as an array of coordinates [x1, y1].
 * @param {Array<number>} point2 - The second point as an array of coordinates [x2, y2].
 * @returns {number} The Euclidean distance between the two points.
 */
```

This JavaScript version uses JSDoc style comments, which are commonly used for documenting JavaScript code. The `@param` tags specify the name and type of each parameter, while the `@returns` tag specifies the return type of the function.
