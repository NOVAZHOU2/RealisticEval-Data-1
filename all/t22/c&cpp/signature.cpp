 * This function computes the Euclidean distance between two points represented 
 * as tuples of coordinates (x, y).
 *
 * @param point1 A tuple representing the first point (x1, y1).
 * @param point2 A tuple representing the second point (x2, y2).
 * @return The Euclidean distance between the two points as a float.
