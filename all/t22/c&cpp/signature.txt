This C++ function `calculateEuclideanDistance` takes two `std::tuple<double, double>` parameters representing the coordinates of two points in a 2D space and returns their Euclidean distance as a `double`. The function uses the standard library's `<cmath>` for mathematical operations including square root and power calculations, ensuring precision in the distance computation.
