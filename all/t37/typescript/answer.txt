Sure! Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python code:

```typescript
import { Matrix } from 'mathjs';

interface QuadratureRule {
    x: Matrix;
    w: Matrix;
}

function lanczos(n: number, quadratureRule: QuadratureRule): [Matrix, Matrix, Matrix, QuadratureRule] {
    // Implement the Lanczos function here
    // This is just a placeholder implementation
    const alpha: Matrix = new Matrix([]);
    const beta: Matrix = new Matrix([]);
    const V: Matrix = new Matrix([]);
    
    return [alpha, beta, V, quadratureRule];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Interface Definition**: We define an interface `QuadratureRule` that matches the structure of the Python class `QuadratureRule`.
2. **Function Signature**: The TypeScript function `lanczos` has the same parameters and return type as the Python function.
3. **Imports**: We use `Matrix` from the `mathjs` library to handle matrix operations. Make sure you have `mathjs` installed in your project.

### Note:
- The actual implementation of the Lanczos function is left as a placeholder. You will need to fill in the logic based on the specific requirements of your application.
- Ensure that the `mathjs` library is installed in your TypeScript project. You can install it using npm or yarn:
  ```sh
  npm install mathjs
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  yarn add mathjs
  ```

This TypeScript code should serve as a good starting point for adapting the Python code to TypeScript.
