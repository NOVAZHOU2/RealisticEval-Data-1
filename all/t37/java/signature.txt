Please note that in Java, there is no direct equivalent to Python's `Tuple` type. Instead, we use an array or a custom class to represent multiple return values. In this case, I've used a `Tuple` class which you would need to define yourself. Also, the Apache Commons Math library is used to handle polynomial functions, but you can replace it with any other library or implementation if needed.
