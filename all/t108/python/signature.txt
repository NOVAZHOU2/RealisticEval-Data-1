To convert the JavaScript function signature you've provided into Python, we need to adjust the syntax and conventions to fit Python's style. Below is the equivalent Python function signature with a docstring that describes the parameters and return values.
Python Code Signature
python
def reorder_data(image_scores: list[int], image_names: list[str], image_ids: list[str]) -> dict:
    """
    Sort the images in ascending order based on their scores and return the reordered image score, name, and ID.

    Args:
        image_scores (list[int]): Array of image scores.
        image_names (list[str]): Array of image names corresponding to the scores.
        image_ids (list[str]): Array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
              For example: {'resultScores': sorted_scores, 'resultNames': sorted_names, 'resultIDs': sorted_ids}
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Changes Explained:
Function Name: The function name is changed to reorder_data to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Types: Python uses type hints to indicate the expected types of parameters. Lists are defined using list[type], and int and str are used for integers and strings, respectively.
Return Type: The return type is indicated using -> dict to specify that the function returns a dictionary.
Docstring: Python uses triple quotes for multi-line comments, and the description is adjusted to match Python's style.
Usage Example
You would call this function similarly to JavaScript, but with Python's syntax:
python
result = reorder_data([10, 5, 2], ["imageA", "imageB", "imageC"], ["idA", "idB", "idC"])
Feel free to implement the sorting logic inside the function as needed!
