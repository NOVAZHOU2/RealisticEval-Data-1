Certainly! Here is the Java method signature with the comments preserved, along with the method body left empty as per your request:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Sort the images in ascending order based on their scores and return the reordered image score, name, and ID.
 *
 * @param imageScores Array of image scores.
 * @param imageNames  Array of image names corresponding to the scores.
 * @param imageIDs    Array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
 * @return A Map containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs. For example: { resultScores, resultNames, resultIDs }
 */
public static Map<String, Object> reorderData(int[] imageScores, String[] imageNames, String[] imageIDs) {
    // Method body left empty
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Method Signature**:
   - The method is declared as `public static`.
   - It takes three parameters: `int[] imageScores`, `String[] imageNames`, and `String[] imageIDs`.
   - It returns a `Map<String, Object>` which will contain the sorted scores, names, and IDs.

2. **Comments**:
   - The comments are preserved exactly as in the JavaScript code.

3. **Empty Method Body**:
   - The method body is left empty as requested.

This Java method signature matches the JavaScript function signature and includes the necessary comments.
