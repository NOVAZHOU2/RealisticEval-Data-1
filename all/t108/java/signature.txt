Hereâ€™s the Java code signature, including the comments, adapted from your JavaScript version:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Sort the images in ascending order based on their scores and return the reordered image score, name, and ID
 *
 * @param imageScores Array of image scores.
 * @param imageNames Array of image names corresponding to the scores.
 * @param imageIDs Array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
 * @return A map containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs, for example { "resultScores", "resultNames", "resultIDs" }
 */
public Map<String, Object> reorderData(int[] imageScores, String[] imageNames, String[] imageIDs) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from your JavaScript function, while conforming to Java syntax.
