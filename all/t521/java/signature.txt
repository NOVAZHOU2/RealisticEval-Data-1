Here is the equivalent Java code signature for your Python function:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class WordFilterCounter {

    /**
     * Counts the occurrences of specified words in the given text.
     *
     * This method filters the words from the text based on the provided list,
     * counts their occurrences, and returns a map with the words in the
     * order they were provided.
     *
     * @param text The input text from which to count words.
     * @param filterWords A list of words to filter and count.
     * @return A map with the count of each filter word in the text,
     *         maintaining the order from filterWords.
     */
    public static Map<String, Integer> wordFilterCounter(String text, List<String> filterWords) {
        // Your implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `wordFilterCounter` method will depend on how you want to achieve the functionality in Java.
