Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python code signature:

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of specified words in the given text.
 *
 * This function filters the words from the text based on the provided array,
 * counts their occurrences, and returns an object with the words in the
 * order they were provided.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The input text from which to count words.
 * @param {Array<string>} filterWords - An array of words to filter and count.
 * @returns {Object} An object with the count of each filter word in the text,
 *                  maintaining the order from filterWords.
 */
```

Please note that JavaScript does not have native support for ordered dictionaries like Python does with `collections.OrderedDict`, so you would need to use an array or another data structure to maintain the order of keys. Also, JavaScript doesn't have type annotations like Python's `typing` module. If you want to keep track of types, consider using TypeScript.
