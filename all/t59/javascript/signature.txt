Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JavaScript documentation standards using JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the probability that x balls will be randomly drawn from a jar containing n red balls and m blue balls, and all of them will be red balls.
 * 
 * @param {number} x - Number of balls to draw.
 * @param {number} n - Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param {number} m - Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * 
 * @returns {number} The probability that all x drawn balls are red.
 */
function probabilityRedBalls(x, n, m) {
    if (x > n) {
        return 0; // Not enough red balls to draw x red balls
    }
    const totalBalls = n + m;
    if (x > totalBalls) {
        return 0; // Not enough balls to draw x balls of any color
    }

    // Number of ways to choose x red balls from n red balls
    const waysToChooseRed = comb(n, x);
    // Total number of ways to choose x balls from all balls
    const totalWaysToChooseBalls = comb(totalBalls, x);

    // Probability that all chosen balls are red
    const probability = waysToChooseRed / totalWaysToChooseBalls;

    return probability;
}

// Import the necessary functions for combinations
const { comb } = require('js-combinatorics');

// Example usage
console.log(probabilityRedBalls(2, 5, 7)); // Example call with x=2, n=5, m=7
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**: The comments have been rewritten using JSDoc format to provide clear documentation for the function parameters and return value.
2. **Function Signature**: The function signature has been preserved, including the parameter types and return type.
3. **Conditional Logic**: The conditional checks and logic remain the same.
4. **Probability Calculation**: The calculation of the probability remains consistent with the Python version.

### Installation of `js-combinatorics`:
Ensure that the `js-combinatorics` package is installed before running this code:

```sh
npm install js-combinatorics
```

This ensures that the `comb` function is available for use in your JavaScript code.
