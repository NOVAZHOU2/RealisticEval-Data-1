Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code that maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the provided Python code:

```javascript
// Import the necessary functions for combinations
const { comb } = require('js-combinatorics');

function probabilityRedBalls(x, n, m) {
    /**
     * Calculate the probability that x balls randomly drawn from a jar containing
     * n red balls and m blue balls will all be red balls.
     *
     * @param {number} x - Number of balls to draw.
     * @param {number} n - Number of red balls in the jar.
     * @param {number} m - Number of blue balls in the jar.
     *
     * @returns {number} - The probability that all x drawn balls are red.
     */
    if (x > n) {
        return 0; // Not enough red balls to draw x red balls
    }
    const totalBalls = n + m;
    if (x > totalBalls) {
        return 0; // Not enough balls to draw x balls of any color
    }

    // Number of ways to choose x red balls from n red balls
    const waysToChooseRed = comb(n, x);
    // Total number of ways to choose x balls from all balls
    const totalWaysToChooseBalls = comb(totalBalls, x);

    // Probability that all chosen balls are red
    const probability = waysToChooseRed / totalWaysToChooseBalls;

    return probability;
}

// Example usage
console.log(probabilityRedBalls(2, 5, 7)); // Example call with x=2, n=5, m=7
```

### Notes:
1. **Combinatorics Library**: In JavaScript, you need to use a library like `js-combinatorics` to calculate combinations. You can install it using npm or include it via a CDN.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `probabilityRedBalls` is defined similarly to the Python function, with the same arguments and docstring.
3. **Conditional Logic**: The conditional checks and logic remain the same.
4. **Probability Calculation**: The calculation of the probability remains consistent with the Python version.

Make sure to install the `js-combinatorics` package before running this code:

```sh
npm install js-combinatorics
```

This ensures that the `comb` function is available for use in your JavaScript code.
