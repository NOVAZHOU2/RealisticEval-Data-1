Here is how you can write the same function signature in TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the probability that x balls will be randomly drawn from a jar containing n red balls and m blue balls, 
 * and all of them will be red balls.
 * @param x - Number of balls to draw.
 * @param n - Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param m - Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @returns The probability that all x drawn balls are red.
 */
function probabilityRedBalls(x: number, n: number, m: number): number {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

The `/** ... */` syntax is used for JSDoc-style comments in TypeScript, which allows you to document your functions in a way that can be read by both humans and tools like documentation generators or linters. 

Please note that the body of the function (`// Function implementation goes here...`) should be filled with the actual logic of the function.
