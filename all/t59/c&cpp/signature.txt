Sure, here is the C++ version of the Python function with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

/**
 * Calculate the probability that x balls will be randomly drawn from a jar 
 * containing n red balls and m blue balls, and all of them will be red balls.
 *
 * @param x Number of balls to draw.
 * @param n Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param m Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @return The probability that all x drawn balls are red.
 */
double probabilityRedBalls(int x, int n, int m) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that you need to implement the actual logic inside the `probabilityRedBalls` function.
