Here is how you can change the Python function signature into Java:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the probability that x balls will be randomly drawn from a jar containing n red balls and m blue balls, 
 * and all of them will be red balls.
 *
 * @param x Number of balls to draw.
 * @param n Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param m Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @return The probability that all x drawn balls are red.
 */
public static double probabilityRedBalls(int x, int n, int m) {
```

In Java, method signatures include the return type, method name, and parameter types. The comments are kept the same as they were in your original Python code. Also note that unlike Python where functions are first-class objects and can be returned or assigned to variables, in Java methods belong to classes and cannot be returned directly from other methods like they can in Python. If you want to "return" a value from a method in Java, you must declare its return type in the method signature. In this case, the method returns a `double`, which represents the probability.
