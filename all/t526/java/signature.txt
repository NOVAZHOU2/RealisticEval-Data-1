Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Find the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
     *
     * @param s The input string in which to search for the substring.
     * @param t The target string whose characters must be included in the substring.
     * @return The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. Returns an empty string if no such substring exists.
     */
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        // Your implementation goes here
        return "";
    }
}
```

In this Java version, I've used a `HashMap` to keep track of character counts similar to how Python's `Counter` would work. However, you'll need to implement the logic inside the `minWindow` method to match the functionality of the original Python function.
