Here is the TypeScript version of your Python code:

```typescript
import { countBy } from 'lodash';

/**
 * Find the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
 *
 * @param s - The input string in which to search for the substring.
 * @param t - The target string whose characters must be included in the substring.
 * @returns The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. Returns an empty string if no such substring exists.
 */
function minWindow(s: string, t: string): string {
```

In this TypeScript code, we're using the `countBy` function from the `lodash` library to count the frequency of each character in the target string `t`. Then we use these counts to determine if our current window has enough characters to satisfy `t`. If it does, we try to minimize the window size. This process continues until we have found the smallest window that satisfies `t`. 

Please note that you need to install lodash before running this script with npm or yarn (`npm install lodash` or `yarn add lodash`).
