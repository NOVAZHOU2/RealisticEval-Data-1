Sure, here is the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
 *
 * @param {string} s - The input string in which to search for the substring.
 * @param {string} t - The target string whose characters must be included in the substring.
 * @return {string} The minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. Returns an empty string if no such substring exists.
 */
function minWindow(s, t) {
```

Note that in JavaScript, you don't need to specify the types of the function parameters or return value in the comment like in Python. Also, the syntax for defining functions and comments differs slightly between languages.
