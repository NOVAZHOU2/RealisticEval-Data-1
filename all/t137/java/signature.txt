Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments, corresponding to the JavaScript function you provided:

```java
/**
 * Merges two maps into one, with properties from the second map
 * potentially overwriting those from the first if there are conflicts.
 *
 * @param obj1 - The first map.
 * @param obj2 - The second map.
 * @return - The resulting map after merging.
 */
public static Map<String, Object> mergeObjects(Map<String, Object> obj1, Map<String, Object> obj2) {
    
}
```

This keeps the comments and adapts the function signature to Java.
