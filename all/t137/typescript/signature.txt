Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Merges two objects into one, with properties from the second object
 * potentially overwriting those from the first if there are conflicts.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, any>} obj1 - The first object.
 * @param {Record<string, any>} obj2 - The second object.
 * @returns {Record<string, any>} - The resulting object after merging.
 */
function mergeObjects(obj1: Record<string, any>, obj2: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any> {

}
```
