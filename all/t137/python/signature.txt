To convert the JavaScript function signature and documentation into a Python function signature with a corresponding docstring, we can follow Python's conventions. Here's how you can represent the mergeObjects function in Python:
Python Function Signature
python
def merge_objects(obj1: dict, obj2: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Merges two dictionaries into one, with properties from the second dictionary
    potentially overwriting those from the first if there are conflicts.

    Args:
        obj1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        obj2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: The resulting dictionary after merging.
    """
    pass  # Replace with the function implementation
Breakdown of the Signature:
Function Name:
The name merge_objects follows the Python convention of using snake_case for function names.
Parameters:
obj1: dict and obj2: dict indicate that both parameters are expected to be dictionaries. In Python, we use type hints to specify the expected types.
Return Type:
-> dict indicates that the function will return a dictionary.
Docstring:
The docstring provides a description of the function's purpose, the parameters it takes, and the return value, similar to how JSDoc comments work in JavaScript.
Summary
This Python function signature captures the essence of the original JavaScript function signature and its documentation while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions. You can then implement the function logic within the pass statement.
