To convert the provided JavaScript Jest test cases into Python test cases using the unittest framework, we need to follow Python's conventions for defining test classes and methods. Below is the equivalent code that reflects the logic of the original tests while adhering to Python's syntax.
Converted Python Test Cases
python
import unittest

def merge_objects(obj1: dict, obj2: dict) -> dict:
    # Merge logic here (implementation not shown)
    pass

class TestMergeObjects(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_correctly_merges_two_objects_with_non_conflicting_keys(self):
        obj1 = {'name': "Alice"}
        obj2 = {'age': 30}
        expected = {'name': "Alice", 'age': 30}
        self.assertEqual(merge_objects(obj1, obj2), expected)

    def test_properties_from_second_object_overwrite_properties_from_first(self):
        obj1 = {'name': "Alice", 'age': 25}
        obj2 = {'age': 30}
        expected = {'name': "Alice", 'age': 30}
        self.assertEqual(merge_objects(obj1, obj2), expected)

    def test_merges_objects_with_nested_structures_correctly(self):
        obj1 = {'user': {'name': "Alice", 'age': 25}}
        obj2 = {'user': {'age': 30}}
        expected = {'user': {'age': 30}}  # Note: obj2 does not merge deeply
        self.assertEqual(merge_objects(obj1, obj2), expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Breakdown of the Python Code:
Importing unittest:
We import the unittest module, which is the standard library for testing in Python.
Function Definition:
A placeholder for the merge_objects function is included. You would replace the pass statement with the actual implementation.
Test Class:
The class TestMergeObjects inherits from unittest.TestCase, allowing it to leverage testing capabilities.
Test Methods:
Each test from the original JavaScript code is converted into a method of the TestMergeObjects class, prefixed with test_ to ensure they are recognized as tests by the unittest framework.
The self.assertEqual() method is used to check if the result from merge_objects() matches the expected output.
Main Block:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block runs the tests when the script is executed directly.
Running the Tests
To execute these tests, save the code to a Python file (e.g., test_merge_objects.py) and run it in a terminal with:
bash
python -m unittest test_merge_objects.py
This will run all the tests and show the results.
