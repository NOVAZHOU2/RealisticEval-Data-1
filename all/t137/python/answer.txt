To convert the provided JavaScript code for merging two objects into Python, we will follow Python's syntax and conventions. Below is the equivalent Python code that performs the same functionality:
Converted Python Code
python
def merge_objects(obj1: dict, obj2: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Merges two dictionaries into one, with properties from the second dictionary
    potentially overwriting those from the first if there are conflicts.

    Args:
        obj1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        obj2 (dict): The second dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: The resulting dictionary after merging.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If either parameter is not a dictionary or is None.
    """
    if not isinstance(obj1, dict) or obj1 is None or isinstance(obj1, list):
        raise TypeError('Both parameters should be non-null dictionaries and not lists.')
    if not isinstance(obj2, dict) or obj2 is None or isinstance(obj2, list):
        raise TypeError('Both parameters should be non-null dictionaries and not lists.')

    # Merge dictionaries, with obj2 overwriting obj1 in case of conflicts
    merged = {**obj1, **obj2}
    return merged
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function is named merge_objects, which follows Python's snake_case naming convention.
Parameter Annotations:
The parameters obj1 and obj2 are annotated with dict, indicating that they are expected to be dictionaries.
Docstring:
A docstring is provided to describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, return type, and potential exceptions.
Type Checking:
We use isinstance() to check if obj1 and obj2 are both dictionaries. The conditions also check if either is None or a list, raising a TypeError if the checks fail.
Merging Dictionaries:
The merging of dictionaries is done using the unpacking operator {**obj1, **obj2}, which creates a new dictionary. If there are overlapping keys, the values from obj2 will overwrite those from obj1, similar to the spread operator in JavaScript.
Usage Example
Hereâ€™s how you might use this function:
python
obj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
obj2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

merged_obj = merge_objects(obj1, obj2)
print(merged_obj)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
This example demonstrates merging two dictionaries, where the key 'b' from obj2 overwrites the value from obj1.
