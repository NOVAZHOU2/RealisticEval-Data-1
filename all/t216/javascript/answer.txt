Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code that maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the provided Python code:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

function getLocalIP(interface = 'wlan0') {
    /**
     * Retrieve the local IP address from the specified network interface.
     *
     * @param {string} interface - The network interface to query. Default is 'wlan0'.
     * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the local IP address,
     *                             or a message indicating no IP was found.
     * @throws {Error} If the subprocess encounters an error or if no suitable IP is found.
     */
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Execute the command to get the IP addresses from the specified interface
        const command = `ip addr show ${interface}`;
        exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
            if (error) {
                // Handle errors from the subprocess command
                reject(new Error(`Failed to retrieve IP address: ${error.message}`));
                return;
            }

            // Regular expression to match IPv4 addresses, excluding the loopback address
            const ipPattern = /inet (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\/\d+/;

            // Search for IP addresses in the command output
            const match = stdout.match(ipPattern);

            // Return the first valid IP found, or throw an error if no IP is found
            if (match) {
                resolve(match[1]);
            } else {
                reject(new Error("No local IP found"));
            }
        });
    });
}

// Example usage:
getLocalIP().then(ip => {
    console.log(ip);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error.message);
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `exec`**: The `exec` function from the `child_process` module is used to run shell commands.
2. **Function Definition**: The `getLocalIP` function is defined to retrieve the local IP address from the specified network interface.
3. **Promise**: The function returns a promise to handle asynchronous operations.
4. **Command Execution**: The `ip addr show` command is executed using `exec`.
5. **Error Handling**: Errors from the subprocess command are caught and thrown as a new `Error`.
6. **Regular Expression**: A regular expression is used to match IPv4 addresses, excluding the loopback address.
7. **Matching IP Addresses**: The command output is searched for IP addresses using the regular expression.
8. **Returning IP Address**: The first valid IP address found is returned, or an error is thrown if no IP is found.
9. **Example Usage**: An example of how to use the function is provided at the end.
