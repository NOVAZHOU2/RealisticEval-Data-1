Here's how you can translate your Python unittest test class into a Jest test case using JavaScript:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

describe('getLocalIP', () => {
  it('should return the local IP address for a given interface', async () => {
    const interfaceName = 'wlan0'; // Change this to the desired interface name
    const expectedPattern = /inet\s+(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/; // Regex pattern to match the IP address

    try {
      const { stdout } = await exec(`ifconfig ${interfaceName}`);
      const match = stdout.match(expectedPattern);

      if (!match) {
        throw new Error('No IP address found');
      }

      expect(match[1]).toMatch(/^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$/); // Validate that the IP address matches the standard format
    } catch (error) {
      expect(error.message).toBe('No IP address found'); // Handle the error case where no IP address is found
    }
  });
});
```

This Jest test case uses `exec` from Node.js's built-in `child_process` module to run the `ifconfig` command and capture its output. It then uses a regular expression to extract the IP address from the output. If an IP address is found, it validates that it matches the standard IPv4 format. If no IP address is found, it throws an error, which is caught and handled in the test case.

Note that you'll need to adjust the `interfaceName` variable to the actual network interface you want to test. Additionally, make sure you have Node.js and Jest installed in your environment before running the test case.
