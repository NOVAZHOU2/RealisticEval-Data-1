Sure, here's the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Gets the IPv4 address of the local computer on a specific network interface, such as wlan0, which is usually a wireless network interface.
 * @param {string} [interface='wlan0'] - The network interface to query. Default is 'wlan0'.
 * @returns {string} The local IP address, or a message indicating no IP was found.
 */
function getLocalIP(interface = 'wlan0') {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Note that in JavaScript, you would typically use Node.js modules like `child_process` to execute system commands and capture their output, similar to how you might use `subprocess` in Python. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might implement the `getLocalIP` function using `child_process`:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const os = require('os');

/**
 * Gets the IPv4 address of the local computer on a specific network interface, such as wlan0, which is usually a wireless network interface.
 * @param {string} [interface='wlan0'] - The network interface to query. Default is 'wlan0'.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the local IP address, or a message indicating no IP was found.
 */
async function getLocalIP(interface = 'wlan0') {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        exec(`ifconfig ${interface}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
            if (error) {
                reject(stderr);
                return;
            }

            const regex = /\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b/g;
            let match;

            while ((match = regex.exec(stdout)) !== null) {
                const ip = match[0];
                if (!ip.startsWith('127.')) {
                    resolve(ip);
                    return;
                }
            }

            resolve('No IP address found.');
        });
    });
}

// Example usage:
getLocalIP().then(ip => console.log(ip)).catch(err => console.error(err));
```

This JavaScript code uses the `exec` function from the `child_process` module to run the `ifconfig` command and extract the IP address from its output. Note that this example assumes you're running it on a Unix-like system where `ifconfig` is available. If you need to support Windows, you might need to use a different command like `ipconfig`.
