Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with comments:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

/**
 * Gets the IPv4 address of the local computer on a specific network interface, such as wlan0,
 * which is usually a wireless network interface.
 *
 * @param interfaceName The network interface to query. Default is "wlan0".
 * @return The local IP address, or a message indicating no IP was found.
 */
public String getLocalIP(String interfaceName) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and purpose as the provided Python function. Note that the actual implementation of fetching the local IP address would need to be added within the method body.
