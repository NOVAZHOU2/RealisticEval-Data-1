Here's the Java method signature corresponding to your TypeScript function, while keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Converts an HSL color value to RGB.
 * Assumes hue, saturation, and lightness are contained in the set [0, 1] and
 * returns r, g, and b in the set [0, 255].
 *
 * @param hue The hue of the color (0-360)
 * @param saturation The saturation of the color (0-1)
 * @param lightness The lightness of the color (0-1)
 * @return An array containing the red, green, and blue channels.
 */
public static int[] hslToRgb(double hue, double saturation, double lightness) {
}
```

In this Java signature, the return type is changed to an `int[]` to represent the RGB values as an array.
