Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature for the `hslToRgb` function, keeping the comments from your TypeScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Converts an HSL color value to RGB.
 * Assumes h, s, and l are contained in the set [0, 1] and
 * returns r, g, and b in the set [0, 255].
 *
 * @param hue The hue of the color (0-360)
 * @param saturation The saturation of the color (0-1)
 * @param lightness The lightness of the color (0-1)
 * @return A struct containing the red, green, and blue channels.
 */
RGB hslToRgb(double hue, double saturation, double lightness);
```

### Changes:
- The return type is changed to `RGB`, a struct that will contain the RGB values.
- The parameter types are specified as `double` to match the TypeScript `number` type.
- The comments and documentation have been preserved.
