Sure! Here is the JavaScript version of the Python function with the same signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array
 * @param {Array} multiDimArray - A multi-dimensional array (nested array).
 * @returns {Array} - A one-dimensional array containing all elements of the input.
 */
function flattenArray(multiDimArray) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In JavaScript, we don't have type annotations like in Python, but you can still include JSDoc comments to document the function's parameters and return value. This helps with readability and understanding for other developers working on your code.
