Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array.
 * 
 * @param multiDimArray - A multi-dimensional array (nested array).
 * @returns A one-dimensional array containing all elements of the input.
 */
function flattenArray(multiDimArray: any[]): any[] {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

In TypeScript, `any[]` is used to represent an array that can contain any type of elements. If you know the specific types of elements in your arrays, you should replace `any` with those specific types for better type safety and readability.
