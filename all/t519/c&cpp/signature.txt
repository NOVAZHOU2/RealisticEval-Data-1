Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Transpose a given matrix (2D array).
 *
 * @param matrix The input 2D vector to be transposed.
 * @return The transposed 2D vector.
 */
std::vector<std::vector<int>> transposeMatrix(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same structure and purpose as your Python function. It takes a constant reference to a `std::vector` of `std::vector`s of integers as an argument and returns a `std::vector` of `std::vector`s of integers representing the transposed matrix.
