Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Transpose a given matrix (2D array).
 *
 * @param {number[][]} matrix - The input 2D array to be transposed.
 * @returns {number[][]} - The transposed 2D array.
 */
function transposeMatrix(matrix) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

This JavaScript function has the same parameters and return type as the original Python function. Note that in JavaScript, we use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single-line comments. Also, JavaScript does not have explicit type annotations like Python, so we use JSDoc style comments to describe the types of the arguments and the return value.
