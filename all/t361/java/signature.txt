Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code based on your C++ snippet:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * @brief Computes the approximate integral of a function using Simpson's Rule.
 *
 * Simpson's Rule is a method for numerical integration that approximates the integral of a function
 * over an interval by fitting parabolas. This function divides the interval [a, b] into n subintervals
 * and calculates the weighted sum of the function values at specific points.
 *
 * @param a The lower limit of integration.
 * @param b The upper limit of integration.
 * @param n The number of subintervals (must be even).
 * @return The approximate value of the integral.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If n is not positive or if it is not even.
 */
public double simpsonsRule(double a, double b, int n) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
