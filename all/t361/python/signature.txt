Here’s the converted C++ code signature to Python code signature while keeping the comments and changing them to Python style comments:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
# Custom exception for invalid arguments
class InvalidArgumentError(Exception):
    pass

# Computes the approximate integral of a function using Simpson's Rule.
#
# Simpson's Rule is a method for numerical integration that approximates the integral of a function
# over an interval by fitting parabolas. This function divides the interval [a, b] into n subintervals
# and calculates the weighted sum of the function values at specific points.
#
# Parameters:
# a: The lower limit of integration.
# b: The upper limit of integration.
# n: The number of subintervals (must be even).
#
# Returns:
# The approximate value of the integral.
#
# Raises:
# InvalidArgumentError: If n is not positive or if it is not even.
def simpsons_rule(a: float, b: float, n: int) -> float:
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Changes:
Class for Exception:
Added a custom exception InvalidArgumentError to mimic the C++ exception for invalid arguments.
Function Signature:
The function signature now uses Python’s type hints for parameters (a, b, and n) and the return type (-> float).
Comment Style:
The C++ block comments have been converted to Python's single-line comments using the # symbol. The structure and content of the comments are preserved for clarity.
Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is included as a placeholder for the function implementation, which can be filled in later.
This format maintains the clarity of the original C++ code while adapting it to Python's syntax and conventions.
