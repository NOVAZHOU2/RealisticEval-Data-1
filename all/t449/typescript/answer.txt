Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function:

```typescript
/**
 * Converts a string to Base64 encoding.
 *
 * @param {string} input - The string to be converted to Base64.
 * @returns {string} The Base64 encoded string.
 */
function convertToBase64(input: string): string {
    return btoa(input);
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The function parameter `input` is explicitly typed as `string`.
- The return type of the function is explicitly typed as `string`.

The `btoa` function is used to encode the input string in Base64. Make sure that you have the necessary environment support for `btoa`, as it is a built-in global function in browsers and Node.js environments.
