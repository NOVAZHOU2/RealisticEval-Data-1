Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts a string to Base64 encoding.
 *
 * @param input The string to be converted to Base64.
 * @return The Base64 encoded string.
 */
public String convertToBase64(String input) {
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same pattern and includes the necessary Javadoc comments for documentation purposes.
