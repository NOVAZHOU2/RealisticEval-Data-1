Here is the equivalent Java code for your JavaScript function:

```java
import java.util.Base64;

/**
 * Converts a string to Base64 encoding.
 *
 * @param input - The string to be converted to Base64.
 * @return The Base64 encoded string.
 */
public static String convertToBase64(String input) {
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(input.getBytes());
}
```

This method uses Java's built-in `Base64` encoder from the `java.util` package to encode the given string into a Base64 format. The `getBytes()` method of the `String` class is used to get an array of bytes representing the characters in the string. These bytes are then passed to the `encodeToString()` method which converts them into a Base64-encoded string.
