Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ test case using Catch2 for the provided JavaScript Jest test function.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your project. If not, you can install it via vcpkg or manually include the headers.

Here's the C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Function to convert a string to Base64 encoding (placeholder implementation)
std::string convertToBase64(const std::string& input) {
    // Placeholder implementation: This should be replaced with actual Base64 encoding logic
    return "base64:" + input;
}

TEST_CASE("Converts a string to Base64 encoding", "[convertToBase64]") {
    SECTION("Empty string") {
        REQUIRE(convertToBase64("") == "base64:");
    }

    SECTION("Single character") {
        REQUIRE(convertToBase64("a") == "base64:a");
    }

    SECTION("Multiple characters") {
        REQUIRE(convertToBase64("hello") == "base64:hello");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` line includes the Catch2 testing framework.
2. **Function Implementation**: The `convertToBase64` function is implemented as a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with actual Base64 encoding logic.
3. **Test Case**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a test case named "Converts a string to Base64 encoding".
4. **Sections**: Each `SECTION` within the `TEST_CASE` represents a specific sub-test case. For example, one section tests an empty string, another tests a single character, and so on.
5. **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to assert that the output of `convertToBase64` matches the expected result.

Make sure to link against the Catch2 library when compiling your test program. If you're using a build system like CMake, you might add something like this to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(Catch2 REQUIRED)
add_executable(your_test_program your_test_file.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test_program Catch2::Catch2)
```

This will compile and run your test case using Catch2.
