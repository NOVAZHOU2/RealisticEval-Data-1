Here’s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function to Python. In Python, you can use the built-in base64 module to handle Base64 encoding. Below is the equivalent Python code, including the function and its docstring.
Python Code
python
import base64

def convert_to_base64(input: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts a string to Base64 encoding.

    Args:
        input (str): The string to be converted to Base64.

    Returns:
        str: The Base64 encoded string.
    """
    # Convert the input string to bytes using UTF-8 encoding
    input_bytes = input.encode('utf-8')
    # Encode the bytes to Base64
    base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(input_bytes)
    # Convert the Base64 bytes back to a string
    return base64_bytes.decode('utf-8')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_string = "Hello, World!"
    encoded_string = convert_to_base64(original_string)
    print(f"Original: {original_string}")
    print(f"Base64 Encoded: {encoded_string}")
Explanation:
Import the Base64 Module:
The base64 module is imported to handle Base64 encoding.
Function Definition:
The function convert_to_base64 takes a single parameter input, which is expected to be a string.
Docstring:
The docstring describes the function’s purpose, its parameters, and the return value, following Python conventions.
Encoding the String:
The input string is converted to bytes using the encode method with UTF-8 encoding: input.encode('utf-8').
Base64 Encoding:
The bytes are then encoded to Base64 using base64.b64encode(input_bytes).
Decoding the Base64 Bytes:
The Base64 encoded bytes are converted back to a string using decode('utf-8').
Example Usage:
An example usage of the function is included in the if __name__ == "__main__": block. This will print the original string and its Base64 encoded version when the script is executed directly.
Running the Code
You can save the code into a Python file (e.g., base64_converter.py) and run it using:
bash
python base64_converter.py
This will output:
Original: Hello, World!
Base64 Encoded: SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
This shows the original string along with its Base64 encoded representation.
