Certainly! Below is the Python code signature with the same comments:

```python
"""
Converts a string to Base64 encoding.

:param input: The string to be converted to Base64.
:type input: str
:return: The Base64 encoded string.
:rtype: str
"""
def convert_to_base64(input):
    pass
```

In Python, we use docstrings to document functions, and the `:type` and `:rtype` annotations help clarify the types of the parameters and return value.
