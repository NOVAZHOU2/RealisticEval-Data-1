Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param filePath The path of the file to read.
 * @param word1 The first word to search for.
 * @param word2 The second word to search for.
 * @return The minimum distance between the two words and the line number where it occurred.
 */
public int[] getMinDistance(String filePath, String word1, String word2) {
    // Method implementation goes here.
}
```

In this Java version, I've used `String` parameters instead of Python's `str`, and the method returns an array containing the minimum distance and the line number where it occurred. This is because Java does not have a built-in way to return multiple values directly from a method like Python does with tuples.
