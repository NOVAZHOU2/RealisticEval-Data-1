Sure, hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method signature along with the Javadoc comments:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WordDistanceFinder {

    /**
     * Finds the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file 
     * and returns in which line the distance occurred.
     *
     * @param filePath the path to the file
     * @param word1 the first word to find
     * @param word2 the second word to find
     * @return the line number where the minimum distance occurred
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
     */
    public int getMinDistance(String filePath, String word1, String word2) throws IOException {
        // Method implementation goes here
        return 0; // Placeholder return value
    }
}
```

In this Java version:
- The method `getMinDistance` is part of a class named `WordDistanceFinder`.
- The method includes a Javadoc comment that describes the purpose of the method, its parameters, and any exceptions it might throw.
- The method signature includes a `throws IOException` clause to handle potential I/O errors when reading the file.
- The return type is `int`, assuming that the method returns the line number where the minimum distance occurred. If the actual return type differs, adjust accordingly.
