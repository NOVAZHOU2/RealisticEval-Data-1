Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments that preserve the purpose and structure of the Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns {[number | null, number | null]} - An array containing the line number and the minimum distance, or [null, null] if not found.
 */
function getMinDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`.
   - Each parameter is documented with `@param`, specifying the type and a brief description.
   - The return value is documented with `@returns`, specifying the type and a brief description.

2. **Function Signature**:
   - The function name `getMinDistance` is preserved.
   - The parameters `filePath`, `word1`, and `word2` are documented with their types and descriptions.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The return value is documented as an array `[number | null, number | null]`, indicating that it can return either a line number and distance or `[null, null]` if not found.

Here's the complete implementation of the function:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

/**
 * Read the file and convert each line into an array of words.
 * 
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file.
 * @returns {Array<Array<string>>} - An array of arrays, where each inner array represents a line of words.
 */
function readFileAsSequences(filePath) {
    const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
    return lines.map(line => line.trim().split(/\s+/));
}

/**
 * Find the indices of two words in a sequence and calculate their closest distances.
 * 
 * @param {Array<string>} sequence - The sequence of words.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns {number} - The minimum distance between the two words.
 */
function findClosestWordIndices(sequence, word1, word2) {
    let word1Indices = [];
    let word2Indices = [];
    let minDistance = Infinity;

    sequence.forEach((word, index) => {
        if (word === word1) {
            word1Indices.push(index);
        } else if (word === word2) {
            word2Indices.push(index);
        }
    });

    word1Indices.forEach(index1 => {
        word2Indices.forEach(index2 => {
            let distance = Math.abs(index1 - index2);
            if (distance < minDistance) {
                minDistance = distance;
            }
        });
    });

    return minDistance;
}

/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 * 
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns {[number | null, number | null]} - An array containing the line number and the minimum distance, or [null, null] if not found.
 */
function getMinDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    const sequences = readFileAsSequences(filePath);
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    let minSeqNum = null;

    sequences.forEach((seq, i) => {
        let distance = findClosestWordIndices(seq, word1, word2);
        if (distance < minDistance) {
            minDistance = distance;
            minSeqNum = i;
        }
    });

    return minDistance !== Infinity ? [minSeqNum, minDistance] : [null, null];
}

// Example usage
const filePath = 'example.txt';
const word1 = 'hello';
const word2 = 'world';

console.log(getMinDistance(filePath, word1, word2));
```

### Explanation of the Complete Implementation:
1. **`readFileAsSequences`**:
   - Reads the file content and splits it into lines.
   - Converts each line into an array of words.

2. **`findClosestWordIndices`**:
   - Finds the indices of the two words in a sequence and calculates their closest distances.

3. **`getMinDistance`**:
   - Determines the minimum distance between two words in any line of a file.
   - Uses the helper functions `readFileAsSequences` and `findClosestWordIndices`.

This implementation ensures that the functionality, logic, and structure are preserved, and the comments are formatted according to JSDoc standards.
