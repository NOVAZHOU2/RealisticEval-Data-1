Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param {string} file_path - The path to the file.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function getMinDistance(file_path, word1, word2) {
    // Your implementation goes here...
}
```

This JavaScript function `getMinDistance` has the same parameters and docstring as your original Python function. You can now implement the logic inside the function body.
