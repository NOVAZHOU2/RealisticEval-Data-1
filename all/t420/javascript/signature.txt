Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to find.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to find.
 * @returns {number|string} - The line number where the minimum distance occurred or a message if not found.
 */
function getMinDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

In this translation:
- The Python function `def get_min_distance(file_path, word1, word2):` is converted to the JavaScript function `function getMinDistance(filePath, word1, word2)`.
- The parameter names are adjusted to follow camelCase convention commonly used in JavaScript.
- JSDoc comments are added to describe the purpose, parameters, and return value of the function.
