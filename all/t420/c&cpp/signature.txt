Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the input file.
 * @param word1 The first word to search for.
 * @param word2 The second word to search for.
 * @return A pair consisting of the minimum distance and the line number where it occurred.
 */
std::pair<int, int> getMinDistance(const std::string& file_path, const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2);
```

### Explanation:
- `/** ... */`: This is a multi-line comment in C++ that serves the same purpose as Python's docstrings.
- `@param`: Used to document each parameter of the function.
- `@return`: Describes what the function returns.
- `std::pair<int, int>`: Specifies the return type of the function, which is a pair of integers representing the minimum distance and the line number.
- `const std::string&`: Passes the string parameters by reference to avoid copying large strings.

This C++ function signature should provide clear documentation about its purpose, parameters, and return value, similar to the provided Python function signature.
