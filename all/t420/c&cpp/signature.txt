Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature and documentation for the provided Python function, including appropriate comments and type translations.

### Python Function:
```python
def get_min_distance(file_path, word1, word2):
    """
    Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file.
        word1 (str): The first word to search for.
        word2 (str): The second word to search for.

    Returns:
        A pair of integers representing the line number and the minimum distance.
    """
```

### Equivalent C++ Function:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <limits>
#include <utility> // For std::pair

/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the file.
 * @param word1 The first word to search for.
 * @param word2 The second word to search for.
 * @return A pair of integers representing the line number and the minimum distance.
 */
std::pair<int, int> get_min_distance(const std::string& file_path, const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2);

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string file_path = "example.txt";
    std::string word1 = "word1";
    std::string word2 = "word2";

    auto result = get_min_distance(file_path, word1, word2);
    std::cout << "Minimum sequence number: " << result.first << ", Minimum distance: " << result.second << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `get_min_distance` is defined with the same parameters and return type.
   - The function returns a `std::pair<int, int>` to represent the line number and the minimum distance.

2. **Documentation Comments**:
   - Multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) are used for the function documentation.
   - Single-line comments (`//`) are used for inline comments.

3. **Include Directives**:
   - Necessary headers are included at the beginning of the file.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - The `main` function demonstrates how to call `get_min_distance` and print the results.

This ensures that the C++ version preserves the original purpose and structure of the Python function, including its documentation and type annotations.
