To convert the given Python `unittest` test class to a C++ test case using Catch2, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the function**: Ensure that your function is defined correctly.
2. **Create the test case**: Use Catch2 macros to create the test cases.

Here's how you can do it:

### Python Function
```python
def get_min_distance(file_path, word1, word2):
    """
    Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred

    Args:
        file_path (str):
        word1 (str):
        word2 (str):

    Returns:

    """
    # Implementation of the function goes here
    pass
```

### C++ Test Case Using Catch2
First, ensure you have Catch2 installed. You can download it from [Catch2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Then, create a C++ file (e.g., `test_get_min_distance.cpp`) with the following content:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch.hpp"

// Include the header file where get_min_distance is declared
#include "get_min_distance.h"  // Assuming the function is in a separate file named get_min_distance.h

TEST_CASE("Test get_min_distance", "[get_min_distance]") {
    // Mocking the file reading functionality for testing purposes
    std::istringstream mock_file_content(
        "line1 word1 word2\n"
        "line2 word2 word1\n"
        "line3 word1 word1\n"
        "line4 word2 word2"
    );

    // Redirect cin to our mock file content
    auto cin_backup = std::cin.rdbuf(mock_file_content.rdbuf());

    SECTION("Test with valid input") {
        int result = get_min_distance("", "word1", "word2");
        REQUIRE(result == 0);  // Assuming the function returns the line number where the minimum distance occurs
    }

    SECTION("Test with invalid input") {
        int result = get_min_distance("", "word1", "nonexistent_word");
        REQUIRE(result == -1);  // Assuming the function returns -1 if word2 is not found
    }

    // Restore cin buffer
    std::cin.rdbuf(cin_backup);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` directive tells Catch to generate a `main()` function for you. The `#include "catch.hpp"` includes the Catch2 library.
2. **Mock File Reading**: For testing purposes, we use an `std::istringstream` to simulate the file content. We then redirect `std::cin` to this stream to read from the mocked data.
3. **Test Cases**: We define two sections (`SECTION`) within the `TEST_CASE`. Each section contains assertions to validate the behavior of the `get_min_distance` function.
4. **Restore Input Buffer**: After running the tests, we restore the original input buffer.

Make sure to compile and run your test case using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later, and link against the Catch2 library. For example, using g++, you might compile and run like this:

```sh
g++ -std=c++11 -I/path/to/catch2/include -o test_get_min_distance test_get_min_distance.cpp
./test_get_min_distance
```

Replace `/path/to/catch2/include` with the actual path to the Catch2 include directory on your system.
