Sure! Below is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same docstring:

```typescript
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 *
 * @param file_path - The path to the file containing the text.
 * @param word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns An object containing the minimum distance and the line number where it occurred, or null if the words were not found.
 */
function getMinDistance(file_path: string, word1: string, word2: string): { minDistance: number; lineNumber: number } | null {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The `@param` tags are used to describe each parameter.
- The `@returns` tag describes the return type, which is an object containing the minimum distance and the line number, or `null` if the words were not found.
- The function signature uses TypeScript's type annotations for better type safety and clarity.
