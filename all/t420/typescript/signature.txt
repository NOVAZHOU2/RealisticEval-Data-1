Sure, hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function, including the documentation comments in the JSDoc style:

```typescript
/**
 * Find the minimum distance between two specified words (word1 and word2) from the file and return in which line the distance occurred.
 * 
 * @param file_path - The path to the file.
 * @param word1 - The first word to find.
 * @param word2 - The second word to find.
 * @returns The line number where the minimum distance occurred.
 */
function getMinDistance(file_path: string, word1: string, word2: string): number {
    // Implementation of the function goes here.
}
```

In this TypeScript code:
- The function `getMinDistance` has been defined with the same name and parameters as the Python function.
- Type annotations have been added for each parameter (`file_path`, `word1`, and `word2`) and the return type.
- The JSDoc-style documentation comments have been included to describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, and the return value.

Feel free to implement the logic inside the function as needed.
