To convert your Python `unittest` test class to a C++ test case using Catch2, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Catch2 if you haven't already. You can download it from [Catch2's GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
2. Write the equivalent C++ test cases using Catch2 syntax.

Here is an example of how you might translate your Python `unittest` test class into a C++ test case using Catch2:

### Python unittest Example (Assuming some tests for the `cycles_by_size` method)
```python
import unittest
from my_module import Graph  # Adjust the import according to your project structure

class TestGraph(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2)]
        self.graph = Graph(self.edges)

    def test_cycles_by_size(self):
        result = self.graph.cycles_by_size()
        expected = {4: [nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)])]}
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Corresponding C++ Test Case Using Catch2
First, make sure you have included Catch2 in your project. You can do this by adding the following lines at the top of your C++ file:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch.hpp"
#include <networkx.hpp>  // Assuming you have a C++ version of NetworkX or a suitable alternative
```

Then, write the equivalent test case:

```cpp
#include "my_module.h"  // Adjust the include according to your project structure
#include <catch.hpp>
#include <networkx.hpp>  // Assuming you have a C++ version of NetworkX or a suitable alternative

TEST_CASE("Test cycles_by_size", "[Graph]") {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 0}, {0, 2}};
    Graph graph(edges);

    auto result = graph.cycles_by_size();
    REQUIRE(result.size() == 1);
    REQUIRE(result[4].size() == 1);

    // Assuming nx::Graph has a method to check if two graphs are equal
    bool areEqual = result[4][0] == nx::Graph({{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 0}});
    REQUIRE(areEqual);
}
```

### Explanation
- **Catch2 Macros**: `TEST_CASE`, `REQUIRE`: These macros are used to define test cases and assertions respectively.
- **Assertions**: `REQUIRE`: This macro checks if the condition is true and fails the test if not.
- **NetworkX Integration**: Since there isn't a direct C++ equivalent of NetworkX, you'll need to either find a C++ library that provides similar functionality or implement the necessary methods yourself.

This should give you a good starting point for converting your Python `unittest` test class to a C++ test case using Catch2. Make sure to adjust the imports and implementation details according to your specific project setup and requirements.
