Sure, here is the C++ code signature equivalent to your Python code, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

// Assuming we have a custom DirectedGraph class and CycleFinder class defined somewhere

/**
 * Finds all unique cycles in the directed graph that are larger than size 2,
 * optionally filtering out cycles with repeated nodes.
 *
 * @param filterRepeatNodes If true, filters out cycles where any node appears more than once.
 * @return A map where keys are cycle sizes and values are lists of subgraphs representing each unique cycle of that size.
 */
std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<DirectedGraph>> cyclesBySize(bool filterRepeatNodes = true);
```

Please note that in C++, you would need to define the `DirectedGraph` class and implement the `cyclesBySize` function according to your specific requirements. The provided signature assumes these classes and functions exist.
