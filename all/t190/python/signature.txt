Hereâ€™s the converted Python function signature based on the provided C++ code. I've kept the comments and converted them to Python style.
Converted Python Code Signature:
python
def hex_string_to_float(hex_str: str) -> float:
    """
    Parses a given hexadecimal string into its corresponding floating-point number and returns the float value.

    :param hex_str: The hexadecimal string to be parsed.
    :return: The corresponding floating-point number.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The C++ function name hexStringToFloat has been converted to hex_string_to_float to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameters and Return Type:
The parameter const std::string& hexStr is changed to hex_str: str in Python.
The return type float is retained in the Python signature as -> float.
Docstring:
The C++ comment block has been converted to a Python docstring ("""), which describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.
Placeholder Implementation:
A pass statement is included to indicate that the function is currently not implemented. You would replace this with the actual implementation as needed.
This Python function signature is now ready for further development with the appropriate implementation details.
