Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java version of the provided C++ function signature, including Javadoc comments:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Parses a given hexadecimal string into its corresponding floating-point number and returns the float value.
 *
 * @param hexStr the hexadecimal string to be parsed
 * @return the corresponding float value
 */
public float hexStringToFloat(String hexStr) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In this conversion, the C++ comments were changed to Java-style Javadoc comments, and the parameter type was adjusted from `const std::string&` to `String`. If you need further implementation details or additional conversions, let me know!
