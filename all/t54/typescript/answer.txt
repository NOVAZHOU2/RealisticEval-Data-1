Here is your Python function converted into TypeScript:

```typescript
function removeTripleBackticks(stringArray: string[]): string[] {
    /**
     * Process an array of strings, removing the three consecutive backticks from each string
     * @param {string[]} stringArray - The array of strings to process.
     * 
     * @returns {string[]} A new array with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
     */
    
    return stringArray.map((str) => str.replace(/```/g, ''));
}
```

This TypeScript function does exactly the same thing as your original Python function. It takes in an array of strings and returns a new array where every occurrence of three consecutive backticks has been replaced with nothing. The regular expression `/```/g` is used to find all occurrences of three consecutive backticks globally in each string. The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, it's replacing the triple backticks with an empty string for each string in the input array.
