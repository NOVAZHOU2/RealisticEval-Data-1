Certainly! Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function, including appropriate JSDoc-style documentation:

```typescript
import { List } from "typescript";

/**
 * Processes a list of strings, removing all occurrences of three consecutive backticks from each string.
 * 
 * @param stringList - The list of strings to process.
 * @returns A new list with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
 */
function removeTripleBackticks(stringList: string[]): string[] {
    // Use array map method to process each string in the array by removing three consecutive backticks
    const processedList = stringList.map(s => s.replace('```', ''));
    return processedList;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `removeTripleBackticks` takes an array of strings (`stringList`) as an argument and returns an array of strings.
   - The parameter and return types are explicitly defined using TypeScript's type system.

2. **Documentation**:
   - The JSDoc-style comment block is used to document the function, its parameters, and its return value.
   - The `@param` tag is used to describe the input parameter.
   - The `@returns` tag is used to describe the return value.

3. **Array Mapping**:
   - The `map` method is used to iterate over each string in the array and apply the `replace` method to remove occurrences of three consecutive backticks (`'```'`).

Here is the complete TypeScript code with proper documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Processes a list of strings, removing all occurrences of three consecutive backticks from each string.
 * 
 * @param stringList - The list of strings to process.
 * @returns A new list with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
 */
function removeTripleBackticks(stringList: string[]): string[] {
    // Use array map method to process each string in the array by removing three consecutive backticks
    const processedList = stringList.map(s => s.replace('```', ''));
    return processedList;
}
```

This TypeScript code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code, including the documentation.
