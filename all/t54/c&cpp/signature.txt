Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the provided Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Process a list of strings, removing the three consecutive backticks from each string
 *
 * @param string_list The list of strings to process.
 * @return A new list with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
 */
std::vector<std::string> removeTripleBackticks(const std::vector<std::string>& string_list);
```

This C++ code signature includes the necessary `#include` directives for handling vectors and strings, and it keeps the docstring (comments) to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
