Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to a Java method signature while keeping the comments intact:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * Processes a list of strings, removing the three consecutive backticks from each string.
 *
 * @param stringList The list of strings to process.
 * @return A new list with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
 */
public class StringProcessor {
    public static List<String> removeTripleBackticks(List<String> stringList) {
        // Method implementation goes here...
    }
}
```

In this Java version:
- `import` statements are used to include necessary packages.
- The method `removeTripleBackticks` is defined within a class named `StringProcessor`.
- The return type and parameters are explicitly specified using Java's syntax.
- Comments are kept in Javadoc format for better documentation.
