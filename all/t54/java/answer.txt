Here's how you can convert your Python code to Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Answer {

    public static List<String> removeTripleBackticks(List<String> stringList) {
        List<String> resultList = new ArrayList<>();

        for(String str : stringList) {
            String resultStr = str.replaceAll("```", "");
            resultList.add(resultStr);
        }

        return resultList;
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we've defined a method `removeTripleBackticks` in the class `Answer`. This method takes a `List<String>` as an argument and returns a new `List<String>` where every occurrence of three consecutive backticks has been removed from each string. We're using the `replaceAll` function of the `String` class to replace occurrences of "```" with "". 

Please note that Java doesn't have a built-in type for lists like Python does, so we use `ArrayList` instead. Also, Java doesn't have a direct equivalent of Python's type hints, but it does have generics which serve a similar purpose.
