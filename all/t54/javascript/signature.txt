Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Process an array of strings, removing the three consecutive backticks from each string.
 *
 * @param {string[]} stringArray - The array of strings to process.
 * @returns {string[]} A new array with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
 */
function removeTripleBackticks(stringArray) {
    // ...
}
```

In JavaScript, you don't need to specify types in the function signature like in Python, so we just use `{string[]}` and `string[]` to indicate that we're working with arrays of strings. Also, JavaScript uses `/** ... */` syntax for multi-line comments instead of triple quotes.
