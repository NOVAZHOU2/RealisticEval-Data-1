Sure, I can help you convert the Python code to JavaScript while maintaining the same functionality, logic, and structure. Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
function removeTripleBackticks(stringList) {
    /**
     * Processes an array of strings, removing all occurrences of three consecutive backticks from each string.
     *
     * @param {Array} stringList - The array of strings to process.
     * @returns {Array} A new array with all instances of three consecutive backticks removed from each string.
     */
    // Use map function to process each string in the array by removing three consecutive backticks
    const processedList = stringList.map(s => s.replace(/```/g, ''));
    return processedList;
}
```

This JavaScript function `removeTripleBackticks` does the same thing as the Python function `remove_triple_backticks`: it processes an array of strings and removes all occurrences of three consecutive backticks (`````) from each string.
