Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted to Python with comments converted to Python style while keeping the original descriptions intact.
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def power_tail(x: int, y: int, acc: int = 1) -> int:
    """
    Tail-recursive function to calculate x raised to the power y.

    This function uses tail recursion to compute x^y.

    :param x: The base, a non-negative integer.
    :param y: The exponent, a non-negative integer.
    :param acc: The accumulator to hold the intermediate result.

    :return: The result of x raised to the power of y.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Signature:
The C++ signature unsigned power_tail(unsigned x, unsigned y, unsigned acc = 1) is translated to Python as def power_tail(x: int, y: int, acc: int = 1) -> int:.
The unsigned type is replaced with int, as Python does not have an unsigned integer type.
Docstring:
The C++ comment block has been converted to a Python docstring, with the format updated to match Python conventions.
The @param and @return tags are changed to the Python-style :param and :return to describe parameters and return values.
Comments:
The comments were kept and adjusted to be Python-style by converting the C++ comment block into a docstring, which is appropriate for describing functions in Python.
Placeholder for Implementation:
The pass statement is included as a placeholder where the function implementation would go.
You can implement the actual logic inside the power_tail function as needed.
