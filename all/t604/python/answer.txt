Here's how you can convert the provided C++ code for a tail-recursive function that calculates 
x raised to the power 
y into Python code. The comments have been updated to follow Python style while maintaining their original meaning.
Converted Python Code
python
def power_tail(x: int, y: int, acc: int = 1) -> int:
    """ 
    Tail-recursive function to calculate x raised to the power y.

    This function uses tail recursion to compute x^y.

    Args:
        x (int): The base, a non-negative integer.
        y (int): The exponent, a non-negative integer.
        acc (int): The accumulator to hold the intermediate result.

    Returns:
        int: The result of x raised to the power of y.
    """
    # Base case: if exponent y is 0, return the accumulated result
    if y == 0:
        return acc  # Return accumulated result
    
    # Tail-recursive call with decremented exponent and updated accumulator
    return power_tail(x, y - 1, acc * x)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(power_tail(2, 3))  # Outputs 8, since 2^3 = 8
Explanation of the Changes:
Function Signature:
The C++ function unsigned power_tail(unsigned x, unsigned y, unsigned acc = 1) is translated to Python as def power_tail(x: int, y: int, acc: int = 1) -> int:.
The type hints (: int) indicate that x, y, and acc are expected to be integers, and the function returns an integer.
Docstring:
The C++ comment block has been converted to a Python docstring, providing a description of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
Comments:
The comments within the function have been changed to Python-style comments, retaining their original meaning.
Example Usage:
An example usage section (if __name__ == "__main__":) has been added to demonstrate how to call the power_tail function. This allows the code to be executed as a standalone script.
Note on Tail Recursion in Python:
Python does not optimize tail recursion due to its call stack limitations. If y is very large, it may result in a RecursionError. For very large exponents, an iterative approach or using the built-in pow function would be more efficient. Here is a simple iterative version as an alternative:
python
def power_iterative(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """ Iterative function to calculate x raised to the power y. """
    result = 1
    for _ in range(y):
        result *= x
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(power_iterative(2, 3))  # Outputs 8, since 2^3 = 8
Feel free to use either implementation based on your requirements!
