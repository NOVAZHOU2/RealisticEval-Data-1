Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature, adapted from the provided C++ code:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Tail-recursive function to calculate x raised to the power y.
 *
 * This function uses tail recursion to compute x^y.
 *
 * @param {number} x The base, a non-negative integer.
 * @param {number} y The exponent, a non-negative integer.
 * @param {number} acc The accumulator to hold the intermediate result.
 *
 * @return {number} The result of x raised to the power of y.
 */
function powerTail(x, y, acc = 1) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Adaptations:
1. **Function Declaration**: Used `function` keyword for defining the function.
2. **Parameter Types**: Replaced C++ types with JavaScript equivalents, using comments for clarity.
3. **Comments**: Converted C++ comments into JavaScript-style comments.
4. **Memory Management**: JavaScript manages memory automatically, so no explicit declarations are needed.

This structure retains the original functionality and format while adhering to JavaScript conventions.
