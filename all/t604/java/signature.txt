Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method signature and Javadoc comments for the provided C++ function:

```java
/**
 * @brief Tail-recursive function to calculate x raised to the power y.
 *
 * This function uses tail recursion to compute x^y.
 *
 * @param x The base, a non-negative integer.
 * @param y The exponent, a non-negative integer.
 * @param acc The accumulator to hold the intermediate result.
 *
 * @return The result of x raised to the power of y.
 */
public static long powerTail(long x, long y, long acc) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Type Conversion**: `unsigned` in C++ is replaced with `long` in Java to handle non-negative integers.
2. **Method Declaration**: The method is declared as `public static` to align with common Java conventions.
3. **Default Parameter Handling**: Java does not support default parameters directly; if default behavior is needed, consider overloading the method. 

This structure retains the functionality while adapting to Java syntax and conventions.
