Sure, I can help you convert the Python unittest test class to a C++ Catch2 test case. Below is an example of how you might write the equivalent test cases for your `replace_phone_numbers` function using Catch2.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your project. If not, you can install it via vcpkg or manually download it from the official website.

Here's how you can write the test cases:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <string>

// Function to be tested
std::string replace_phone_numbers(const std::string& text) {
    // Implement the function logic here
    return "[PHONE_NUM]";
}

TEST_CASE("Replace Phone Numbers", "[replace_phone_numbers]") {
    SECTION("Single Phone Number") {
        REQUIRE(replace_phone_numbers("Call me at 123-456-7890.") == "Call me at [PHONE_NUM].");
    }

    SECTION("Multiple Phone Numbers") {
        REQUIRE(replace_phone_numbers("Contact us at 123-456-7890 or 987-654-3210.") 
                == "Contact us at [PHONE_NUM] or [PHONE_NUM].");
    }

    SECTION("No Phone Numbers") {
        REQUIRE(replace_phone_numbers("This is just a normal message.") 
                == "This is just a normal message.");
    }

    SECTION("Phone Number with Different Format") {
        REQUIRE(replace_phone_numbers("Reach out at (123) 456-7890.") 
                == "Reach out at [PHONE_NUM].");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` directive includes the Catch2 header file which provides the necessary macros and functions for writing tests.

2. **Function Definition**: The `replace_phone_numbers` function is defined as per your requirements. In the actual implementation, you need to add the logic to replace phone numbers.

3. **Test Case Declaration**: The `TEST_CASE` macro is used to declare a test case named "Replace Phone Numbers". The second argument `[replace_phone_numbers]` is the tag for the test case.

4. **Sections**: Each `SECTION` within a `TEST_CASE` represents a specific scenario or sub-test case. This makes it easier to organize and understand the different test scenarios.

5. **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to make assertions. It checks if the condition is true; if not, the test will fail and provide the expected and actual values.

Make sure to compile your C++ code with the Catch2 library linked correctly. If you're using a build system like CMake, you can link Catch2 by adding the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(Catch2 REQUIRED)
add_executable(your_test_executable your_test_file.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test_executable Catch2::Catch2)
```

This setup should allow you to run your test cases using Catch2.
