Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Classify an array of file names according to their file extensions.
 *
 * @param fileNames List of file names (strings).
 * @return Map with file extensions as keys and lists of file names as values.
 */
public class FileClassifier {

    public static Map<String, List<String>> classifyFilesByExtension(List<String> fileNames) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
}
```

This Java method `classifyFilesByExtension` takes a list of strings (`List<String>`) as input and returns a map (`Map<String, List<String>>`). The comments above the method describe its purpose and parameters.
