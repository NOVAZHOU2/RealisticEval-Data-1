Sure! Below is the JavaScript version of your Python function signature, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Classify an array of file names according to their file extensions.
 *
 * @param {string[]} fileNames - List of file names (strings).
 * @returns {Object} - Object with file extensions as keys and arrays of file names as values.
 */
function classifyFilesByExtension(fileNames) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this JavaScript version:
- The `@param` tag is used to describe the parameters of the function.
- The `@returns` tag is used to describe what the function returns.
- The parameter `fileNames` is typed as `string[]`, which means it's an array of strings.
- The return type is described as `Object`, which corresponds to a dictionary in Python.
