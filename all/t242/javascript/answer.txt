Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the Python function you provided:

```javascript
function classifyFilesByExtension(fileNames) {
  const classifiedFiles = {};

  for (const fileName of fileNames) {
    const extension = fileName.split('.').pop();
    
    if (!classifiedFiles[extension]) {
      classifiedFiles[extension] = [];
    }

    classifiedFiles[extension].push(fileName);
  }
  
  return classifiedFiles;
}
```

This JavaScript function works similarly to your Python function. It iterates over each filename in the input array, extracts its extension, and groups filenames by their respective extensions in an object. If an extension does not exist yet in the object, it initializes an empty array for that extension before pushing the filename into it. Finally, it returns the resulting object.
