Here's how you can translate the Python function signature into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the date of the nth occurrence of a specific weekday (k) in a given month (m) and year (y).
 * If the nth occurrence does not exist within the month, it returns the last occurrence of that weekday in the month.
 * This function extends the capability to handle edge cases where the nth weekday might not be present,
 * by providing the closest previous weekday in such cases
 *
 * @param {number} y - The year for which the date is to be calculated.
 * @param {number} m - The month for which the date is to be calculated, where January is 1 and December is 12.
 * @param {number} n - The nth occurrence of the weekday within the month. For example, 1 for the first occurrence, 2 for the second, etc.
 * @param {number} k - The weekday, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
 * @returns {Date} - The calculated date of the nth occurrence of the weekday in the given month and year.
 * If the nth occurrence does not exist, returns the date of the last occurrence of that weekday in the month.
 */
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments (`/** ... */`) to document functions. The `@param` tag specifies the parameters of the function, including their names, types, and descriptions. The `@returns` tag describes the return value of the function.
