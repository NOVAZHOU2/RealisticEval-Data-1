Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the date of the nth occurrence of a specific weekday (k) in a given month (m) and year (y).
 * If the nth occurrence does not exist within the month, it returns the last occurrence of that weekday in the month.
 * This function extends the capability to handle edge cases where the nth weekday might not be present,
 * by providing the closest previous weekday in such cases.
 * 
 * @param {number} y - The year for which the date is to be calculated.
 * @param {number} m - The month for which the date is to be calculated, where January is 1 and December is 12.
 * @param {number} n - The nth occurrence of the weekday within the month. For example, 1 for the first occurrence, 2 for the second, etc.
 * @param {number} k - The weekday, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.
 * @returns {Date} The calculated date of the nth occurrence of the weekday in the given month and year.
 *                If the nth occurrence does not exist, returns the date of the last occurrence of that weekday in the month.
 */
function findNthWeekdayOfSpecificYear(y, m, n, k) {
    const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(y, m - 1, 1);
    const dayDifference = (k - firstDayOfMonth.getDay() + 7) % 7;
    const firstKWeekdayOfMonth = new Date(firstDayOfMonth.getTime());
    firstKWeekdayOfMonth.setDate(firstDayOfMonth.getDate() + dayDifference);
    const nthKWeekdayOfMonth = new Date(firstKWeekdayOfMonth.getTime());
    nthKWeekdayOfMonth.setDate(firstKWeekdayOfMonth.getDate() + (n - 1) * 7);

    // Calculate the last day of the month
    const nextMonthFirstDay = new Date(y, m, 1);
    const lastDayOfMonth = new Date(nextMonthFirstDay.getTime());
    lastDayOfMonth.setDate(lastDayOfMonth.getDate() - 1);

    if (nthKWeekdayOfMonth > lastDayOfMonth) {
        const lastKWeekdayOfMonth = new Date(lastDayOfMonth.getTime());
        lastKWeekdayOfMonth.setDate(lastDayOfMonth.getDate() - ((lastDayOfMonth.getDay() - k + 7) % 7));
        return lastKWeekdayOfMonth;
    }

    return nthKWeekdayOfMonth;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function signature is defined with JSDoc comments to describe the parameters and return type.
   - The function name is `findNthWeekdayOfSpecificYear`.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comments provide detailed descriptions of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
   - Each parameter is annotated with its type and a brief description.
   - The return type is also annotated with a description.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The implementation closely follows the logic of the Python code.
   - `firstDayOfMonth` initializes the first day of the specified month.
   - `dayDifference` calculates the difference in days between the first day of the month and the desired weekday.
   - `firstKWeekdayOfMonth` sets the date to the first occurrence of the desired weekday in the month.
   - `nthKWeekdayOfMonth` calculates the nth occurrence of the desired weekday.
   - The last day of the month is calculated using `nextMonthFirstDay` and `lastDayOfMonth`.
   - Edge cases are handled to return the last occurrence of the desired weekday if the nth occurrence does not exist within the month.

This JavaScript function should behave identically to the original Python function, with proper documentation and structure preserved.
