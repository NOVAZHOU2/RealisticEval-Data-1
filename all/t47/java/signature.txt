Certainly! Below is the Java equivalent of the provided Python function, including appropriate Javadoc comments and Java conventions:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters;

/**
 * Calculates the date of the nth occurrence of a specific weekday (k) in a given month (m) and year (y).
 * If the nth occurrence does not exist within the month, it returns the last occurrence of that weekday in the month.
 * This function extends the capability to handle edge cases where the nth weekday might not be present,
 * by providing the closest previous weekday in such cases.
 */

     * @param y The year for which the date is to be calculated.
     * @param m The month for which the date is to be calculated, where January is 1 and December is 12.
     * @param n The nth occurrence of the weekday within the month. For example, 1 for the first occurrence, 2 for the second, etc.
     * @param k The weekday, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
     * @return LocalDate The calculated date of the nth occurrence of the weekday in the given month and year.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports for `LocalDate`, `DayOfWeek`, and `TemporalAdjusters` are included to handle dates and weekdays.
2. **Javadoc Comments**: The Javadoc comments provide detailed documentation for the method, including the arguments and return value.
3. **Method Signature**: The method `findNthWeekdayOfSpecificYear` takes four parameters: `y` (year), `m` (month), `n` (occurrence), and `k` (weekday), and returns a `LocalDate`.
4. **Logic**:
   - The first day of the specified month is calculated using `LocalDate.of`.
   - The target weekday is determined using `DayOfWeek.of`.
   - The first occurrence of the target weekday in the month is found using `TemporalAdjusters.nextOrSame`.
   - The nth occurrence of the target weekday is calculated by adding weeks.
   - The last day of the month is determined using `TemporalAdjusters.lastDayOfMonth`.
   - If the nth occurrence is after the last day of the month, the last occurrence of the target weekday is returned.
5. **Example Usage**: A `main` method is provided to demonstrate how to call the `findNthWeekdayOfSpecificYear` method and print the result.
