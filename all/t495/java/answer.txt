### Explanation:
1. **Package and Class Declaration**: The code is organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`.
2. **Method Signature**: The method `filterContentWithContext` is defined with the appropriate parameters and return type.
3. **Regular Expression Compilation**: The regular expression pattern is compiled using `Pattern.compile` to ensure whole word matching.
4. **Line Splitting**: The content is split into lines using `split("\\R")`, which handles different newline characters across platforms.
5. **Matching Logic**: The method iterates over each line and checks for matches using a compiled regular expression pattern.
6. **Context Range Calculation**: The context range is calculated and added to a `HashSet` to avoid duplicates.
7. **Filtered Lines Extraction**: The matched lines and their context are extracted and sorted.
8. **Joining Lines**: The filtered lines are joined back into a single string.
9. **Example Usage**: An example usage is provided in the `main` method to demonstrate how the method can be called.
