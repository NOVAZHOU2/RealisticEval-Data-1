Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code that maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the provided Python code:

```javascript
function filterContentWithContext(content, keywords, linesBefore = 1, linesAfter = 1) {
    /**
     * Filters website content to include lines containing any of the specified keywords as whole words,
     * along with a specified number of lines before and after for context. This version uses regular expressions
     * to ensure exact, whole word matching and respects case sensitivity.
     *
     * @param {string} content - The full text content of the website.
     * @param {Array<string>} keywords - A list of strings to search for within the content.
     * @param {number} linesBefore - Number of lines to include before a matching line.
     * @param {number} linesAfter - Number of lines to include after a matching line.
     *
     * @returns {string} - A string containing the filtered content with additional context.
     */

    // Split the content into individual lines
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    const matchedLines = new Set();  // Use a Set to avoid duplicate lines

    // Iterate over each line to find matches
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
        const line = lines[i];
        for (const keyword of keywords) {
            // Use a regular expression to find whole word matches with exact case
            if (new RegExp(`\\b${escapeRegExp(keyword)}\\b`).test(line)) {
                // Determine the range of lines to include for context
                const contextRange = Array.from({
                    length: linesAfter - linesBefore + 1
                }, (_, k) => Math.max(0, i + k - linesBefore))
                    .filter(index => index < lines.length);
                matchedLines.addAll(contextRange);  // Add the context lines to the set
            }
        }
    }

    // Extract the matched lines and their context, sorted by their original order
    const filteredLines = Array.from(matchedLines).sort((a, b) => a - b).map(i => lines[i]);

    // Join the filtered lines back into a single string
    const filteredContent = filteredLines.join('\n');

    return filteredContent;
}

// Helper function to escape special characters for regular expressions
function escapeRegExp(string) {
    return string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
}

// Polyfill for Set.prototype.addAll if not available
if (!Set.prototype.addAll) {
    Set.prototype.addAll = function addAll(iterable) {
        for (const item of iterable) {
            this.add(item);
        }
    };
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting Content**: The `content` string is split into an array of lines using `\n` as the delimiter.
2. **Regular Expression Matching**: A regular expression is used to match whole words (`\b`) with exact case sensitivity.
3. **Context Range Calculation**: The context range is determined based on the `linesBefore` and `linesAfter` parameters.
4. **Set Operations**: A `Set` is used to store unique matched lines and their context.
5. **Sorting and Joining**: The matched lines are sorted by their original order and joined back into a single string.

This JavaScript code should provide the same functionality as the Python code.
