To convert the given Java function signature into a Python function signature, we need to consider the following aspects:
Parameter Types: In Java, the parameter is defined with a specific type (String), while Python is dynamically typed, so we will simply use a type hint for the string path.
Return Type: In Java, the return type is List<Object>, which indicates a list that can contain any type of object. In Python, we can use list and specify that it can contain int, float, or str.
Exception Handling: The Java method specifies an IllegalArgumentException for I/O errors. In Python, we typically raise an IOError or a generic Exception.
Hereâ€™s how the function signature would look in Python:
python
from typing import List, Union

def read_data_from_file(path: str) -> List[Union[int, float, str]]:
    pass
Breakdown:
path: str: The parameter path is a string representing the file path.
-> List[Union[int, float, str]]: This specifies that the return type is a list containing items that can be of type int, float, or str.
pass: This is a placeholder indicating that the function body is yet to be implemented.
Note:
If you plan to implement the function, you would typically handle file reading and data conversion inside this function, including proper exception handling for I/O errors.
