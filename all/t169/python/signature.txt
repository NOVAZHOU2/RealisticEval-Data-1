Here's the Python code signature that corresponds to the provided TypeScript code signature, including the comments. The signature reflects the same functionality as in TypeScript:
python
def convert_to_roman(num: int) -> str:
    """ 
    Converts an Arabic numeral to its Roman numeral equivalent.

    Args:
        num (int): The number to convert.

    Returns:
        str: The Roman numeral representation of the input number.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name: The function is named convert_to_roman, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type: The parameter num is annotated with the type int to indicate it should be an integer.
Return Type: The return type is annotated as str, indicating that the function will return a string.
Docstring: The comments are converted into a docstring format, which is standard for Python functions.
Implementation Placeholder: A pass statement is included as a placeholder for where the implementation will go.
You can replace the pass statement with the actual implementation as needed.
