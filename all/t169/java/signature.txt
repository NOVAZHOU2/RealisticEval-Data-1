Hereâ€™s the Java method signature that matches the TypeScript code signature, along with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Converts an Arabic numeral to its Roman numeral equivalent.
 *
 * @param num The number to convert.
 * @return The Roman numeral representation of the input number.
 */
public String convertToRoman(int num) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This signature uses the correct Java types and maintains the comments from the original TypeScript code. Let me know if you need further assistance!
