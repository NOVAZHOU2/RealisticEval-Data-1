Here’s the conversion of the TypeScript function signature to a Python function signature while preserving the comments:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def format_number(num: float) -> str:
    """ 
    Format the number into a more readable string representation, returning the original form if the number is less than 1,000. 
    If it is greater than or equal to a thousand and less than a million, it is formatted as "x.xK". 
    For a million or more, format it as "x.xM".
    
    Args:
        num (float): The number to be formatted.
        
    Returns:
        str: The formatted number as a string.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Breakdown of the Signature:
Function Definition:
def format_number(num: float) -> str: defines a function named format_number that takes one argument, num, which is expected to be a float, and returns a string.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are adapted into a docstring format in Python, which provides information about the function’s purpose, parameters, and return values.
Placeholder for Implementation:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder to indicate that the function implementation will go here.
This structure keeps the function signature clear and properly documents the function's intended behavior, matching the style of the original TypeScript code while adapting it for Python.
