Here's the Java code signature with the comments retained, adapted from your TypeScript code:

```java
/**
 * Format the number into a more readable string representation, returning the original form if the number is less than 1,000.
 * If it is greater than or equal to a thousand and less than a million, it is formatted as "x.xK".
 * For a million or more, format it as "x.xM".
 *
 * @param num The number to be formatted.
 * @return The formatted number as a string.
 */
public static String formatNumber(double num) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
``` 

This retains the structure and comments while adapting to Java's syntax.
