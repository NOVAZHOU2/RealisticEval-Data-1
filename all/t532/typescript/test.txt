Sure! Below is the TypeScript version of your Jest test case using `describe`:

```typescript
import { countLetterChanges } from './path-to-your-function'; // Adjust the import path accordingly

describe('countLetterChanges function', () => {
  it('should return an array of counts representing the number of consecutive identical letters', () => {
    expect(countLetterChanges('aaabbccdd')).toEqual([3, 2, 2, 2]);
    expect(countLetterChanges('abcde')).toEqual([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]);
    expect(countLetterChanges('aabbccddeeffgg')).toEqual([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]);
    expect(countLetterChanges('')).toEqual([]);
    expect(countLetterChanges('a')).toEqual([1]);
    expect(countLetterChanges('aaabbbcccddd')).toEqual([3, 3, 3, 3]);
  });
});
```

In this example:
- I've assumed that the `countLetterChanges` function is located in a file named `path-to-your-function.ts`. You should replace `'./path-to-your-function'` with the actual path to your function file.
- The `it` blocks contain various test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected.
- The `expect` statements are used to assert the output of the `countLetterChanges` function against the expected results.

Make sure you have TypeScript and Jest set up correctly in your project for this to work. If you haven't installed Jest yet, you can do so by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
```

Then, add a script to run your tests in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Now you can run your tests by executing:

```bash
npm test
```
