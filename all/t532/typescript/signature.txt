Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to TypeScript while keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns {number[]} An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *                          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
function countLetterChanges(inputString: string): number[] {
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The `inputString` parameter is typed as `string`.
- The return type of the function is specified as `number[]`, indicating an array of numbers.
