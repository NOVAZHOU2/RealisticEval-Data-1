Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns {number[]} An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *                          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
function countLetterChanges(inputString: string): number[] {
}
```

In TypeScript, you need to specify the types of the parameters and the return value explicitly. In this case, `inputString` is of type `string`, and the return value is an array of numbers (`number[]`).
