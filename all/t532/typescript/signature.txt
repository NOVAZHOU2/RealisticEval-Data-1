Here's the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns {Array<number>} An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *                          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
function countLetterChanges(inputString: string): number[] {
}
``` 

This signature includes the type annotations for both the parameter and the return type.
