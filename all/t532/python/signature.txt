Sure, here's the equivalent Python function with the same docstring:

```python
def count_letter_changes(input_string):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.

    :param input_string: The string to analyze for letter changes.
    :type input_string: str
    :return: An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
             identical letters before a different letter is found.
    :rtype: list[int]
    """
```

This Python function has the same purpose and parameters as your JavaScript function, but it uses Python's syntax and conventions. The `@param` and `@return` tags have been replaced with their Python equivalents (`:param`, `:type`, and `:rtype`).
