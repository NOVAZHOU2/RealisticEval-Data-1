Certainly! Below is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same signature and comments:

```python
def count_letter_changes(input_string):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.

    :param input_string: The string to analyze for letter changes.
    :type input_string: str
    :return: An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
             identical letters before a different letter is found.
    :rtype: list[int]
    """
    pass
```

This Python function has the same docstring and parameter types as the original JavaScript function. The `pass` statement is used here to indicate that the function body is intentionally left empty, similar to how an empty function body is represented in JavaScript using curly braces `{}`.
