To convert the JavaScript function signature and accompanying documentation to a Python function signature, we will follow the conventions used in Python, particularly using type hints and docstrings.
Hereâ€™s how the JavaScript function signature can be translated into Python:
JavaScript Signature
javascript
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns {Array<number>} An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *                          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
function countLetterChanges(inputString) {}
Python Signature
python
def count_letter_changes(input_string: str) -> list:
    """Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The string to analyze for letter changes.

    Returns:
        list: A list of counts representing the number of consecutive
              identical letters before a different letter is found.
    """
    pass  # Replace with implementation
Explanation of the Python Code Signature:
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def followed by the function name, which is converted from camelCase in JavaScript to snake_case in Python.
Parameters:
The parameter inputString is renamed to input_string to follow Python's naming convention.
The type hint : str indicates that the parameter should be a string.
Return Type:
The return type -> list specifies that the function will return a list.
Docstring:
The docstring provides a description of what the function does, similar to the JavaScript comment block.
It includes Args for parameters and Returns for the return value.
pass Statement:
The pass statement is a placeholder that can be replaced with the actual implementation of the function.
This Python function signature closely mirrors the intent and structure of the original JavaScript function signature while adhering to Python's conventions.
