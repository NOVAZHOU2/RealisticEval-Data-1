Sure! Below is the equivalent Python unit test case using the `unittest` framework:

```python
import unittest

def count_letter_changes(input_string):
    # Implement your function logic here
    pass

class TestCountLetterChanges(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_count_letter_changes(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_letter_changes("aabbcc"), [2, 2, 2])
        self.assertEqual(count_letter_changes("abcde"), [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
        self.assertEqual(count_letter_changes("aaabbbccc"), [3, 3, 3])
        self.assertEqual(count_letter_changes(""), [])
        self.assertEqual(count_letter_changes("a"), [1])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this Python code:
- We define a function `count_letter_changes` that you need to implement with your logic.
- We create a test class `TestCountLetterChanges` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
- Inside the test class, we define several test methods (e.g., `test_count_letter_changes`) that use assertions to check if the function behaves as expected.

Make sure to replace the `pass` statement inside the `count_letter_changes` function with your actual implementation logic.
