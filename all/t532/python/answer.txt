Here's the equivalent Python function:

```python
def count_letter_changes(input_string):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The string to analyze for letter changes.

    Returns:
        list: A list of counts representing the number of consecutive
              identical letters before a different letter is found.
    """
```

Please note that the JavaScript function `countLetterChanges` does not have any implementation yet. To complete it in Python, you would need to add your own logic based on what you want to achieve with the function.
