Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @return An array of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *         identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
public int[] countLetterChanges(String inputString) {
}
```

This Java method signature matches the JavaScript function signature you provided, including the parameter type (`String`) and return type (`int[]`).
