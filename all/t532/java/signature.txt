Here's the Java code signature with the comments preserved, mirroring the JavaScript format:

```java
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns A list of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
public static List<Integer> countLetterChanges(String inputString) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- Changed `Array<number>` to `List<Integer>` in the JavaDoc comment to reflect Java's type system.
- Used `public static` as part of the method signature to indicate that it's a static method.
- The implementation comment indicates where the actual code would be placed.
