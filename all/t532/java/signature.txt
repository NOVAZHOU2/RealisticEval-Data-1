Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to Java, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @return An array of integers representing the number of consecutive
 *         identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
public static int[] countLetterChanges(String inputString) {
}
```

In Java, we use `int[]` instead of `Array<number>` and specify the return type explicitly with `public static`. Also, we use `String` instead of `{string}`.
