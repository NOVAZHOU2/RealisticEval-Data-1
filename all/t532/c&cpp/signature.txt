Here's the C++ code signature with comments, reflecting the JavaScript format:

```cpp
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @returns A vector of counts representing the number of consecutive
 *          identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
std::vector<int> countLetterChanges(const std::string& inputString) {
}
```

This maintains the original comments while adapting to C++ syntax.
