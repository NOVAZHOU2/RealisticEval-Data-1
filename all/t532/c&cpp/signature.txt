Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code with the same function signature and comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Counts the occurrences of consecutive identical letters in a given string.
 *
 * @param inputString - The string to analyze for letter changes.
 * @return A vector of integers representing the number of consecutive
 *         identical letters before a different letter is found.
 */
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> countLetterChanges(const std::string& inputString) {
}
```

This C++ version uses `std::vector` instead of an array to store the counts, and `const std::string&` for the input parameter to ensure that the original string is not modified.
