Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. The Java code includes handling the input as an array and calculates the total number of seconds based on the given time periods.

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Calculate the total number of seconds given an array of time periods in the order of
     * days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
     *
     * @param time An array where
     *             time[0] - number of days (optional)
     *             time[1] - number of hours (optional)
     *             time[2] - number of minutes (optional)
     *             time[3] - number of seconds (optional)
     * @return The total number of seconds.
     */
    public static int calculateTotalSeconds(int[] time) {
        final int SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400;
        final int SECONDS_PER_HOUR = 3600;
        final int SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60;

        // Ensure the array has at least 4 elements by appending zeros if necessary
        int days = time.length > 0 ? time[0] : 0;
        int hours = time.length > 1 ? time[1] : 0;
        int minutes = time.length > 2 ? time[2] : 0;
        int seconds = time.length > 3 ? time[3] : 0;

        int totalSeconds = (
                days * SECONDS_PER_DAY +
                hours * SECONDS_PER_HOUR +
                minutes * SECONDS_PER_MINUTE +
                seconds
        );
        return totalSeconds;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        System.out.println(calculateTotalSeconds(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4})); // Output: 93784
        System.out.println(calculateTotalSeconds(new int[]{0, 2, 3}));    // Output: 7380
    }
}
```

This Java code follows the same logic as the Python code but adapts to Java's syntax and conventions. It ensures that the input array is properly handled and that the total number of seconds is calculated correctly.
