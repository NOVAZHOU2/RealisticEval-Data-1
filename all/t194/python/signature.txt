Hereâ€™s how to convert the C++ code signature and comments to a Python code signature, including the conversion of C++ style comments to Python style comments:
Converted Python Code Signature with Comments
python
def return_string(str: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns a copy of the specified string via dynamic memory allocation.
    
    :param str: The input string to be copied.
    :return: A copy of the input string.
    :raises ValueError: If the input string is None.
    """
    pass
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Definition:
The C++ function signature char* return_string(const char* str) is converted to def return_string(str: str) -> str: in Python.
The parameter type is annotated as str to indicate that it expects a string input.
The return type is also annotated as str to indicate that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted to a Python docstring using triple quotes ("""), which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
The @brief, @param, @return, and @throws comments are adapted to the following format in Python:
A general description of the function is provided in the first line.
The parameters and return values are described using :param, :return, and :raises syntax.
Exception Handling:
Instead of std::invalid_argument, which is used in C++, Python uses built-in exceptions like ValueError for invalid arguments.
This format preserves the intent of the original C++ function signature while adapting it to Python conventions.
