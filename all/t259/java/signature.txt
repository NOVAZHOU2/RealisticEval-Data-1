Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to Java:

```java
/**
 * Determine whether a number is a compliant four-digit number.
 *
 * @param number The number to check.
 * @return true if the number is a compliant four-digit number, false otherwise.
 */
public boolean isCompliantFourDigit(int number) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

In Java, method signatures include the return type (`boolean` in this case), followed by the method name (`isCompliantFourDigit`). The parameters are enclosed within parentheses and each parameter has its type specified before it. Java also uses Javadoc style comments for documentation, similar to Python's docstrings.
