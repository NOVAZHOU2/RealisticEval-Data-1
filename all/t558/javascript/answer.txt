Sure, I can help you with that. Below is the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided Python function:

```javascript
function degreesToRadians(degrees) {
    /**
     * Convert an angle from degrees to radians.
     *
     * @param {number} degrees - The angle in degrees to convert.
     * @returns {number} The angle in radians.
     */
    const radians = degrees * (Math.PI / 180);
    return radians;
}
```

This JavaScript function `degreesToRadians` mirrors the functionality of the Python function `degrees_to_radians`. It takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The logic and structure are kept consistent with the original Python code.
