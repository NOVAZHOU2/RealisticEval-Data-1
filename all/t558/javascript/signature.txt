Certainly! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert an angle from degrees to radians.
 * 
 * @param {number} degrees - The angle in degrees to convert.
 * @returns {number} The angle in radians.
 */
function degreesToRadians(degrees) {
    const radians = degrees * (Math.PI / 180);
    return radians;
}
```

In this JavaScript code:
- The function name `degrees_to_radians` is converted to `degreesToRadians` to follow camelCase naming conventions commonly used in JavaScript.
- The type hints from the Python function signature (`degrees: int` and `-> float`) are translated into JSDoc comments specifying the parameter and return types.
- The docstring is rewritten in JSDoc format to provide clear documentation for the function.
