Here is the equivalent C++ code for your Python function:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

double degreesToRadians(int degrees)
{
    return degrees * M_PI / 180.0;
}
```

And here is the equivalent C code for your Python function:

```c
#include <math.h>

double degreesToRadians(int degrees)
{
    return degrees * M_PI / 180.0;
}
```
Both of these functions take an integer representing an angle in degrees and return that angle converted to radians.
