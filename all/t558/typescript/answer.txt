Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function degreesToRadians(degrees: number): number {
    /**
     * Convert an angle from degrees to radians.
     *
     * @param degrees - The angle in degrees to convert.
     * @returns The angle in radians.
     */
    return degrees * Math.PI / 180;
}
```

In TypeScript, you don't need to specify that the parameter and return type of the function are numbers; it's inferred automatically from the value passed into the function. However, if you want to be explicit about the types, you can do so as shown above. Also, note that `Math.PI` is used instead of `math.pi` in TypeScript.
