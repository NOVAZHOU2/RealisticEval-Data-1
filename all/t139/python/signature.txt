To convert the JavaScript function signature and accompanying documentation into a Python function signature and docstring, you can follow the conventions used in Python, particularly with respect to type hints and documentation. Here's how the equivalent Python code would look:
python
def parse_categories_from_summary(summarized_output: str = '') -> dict:
    """
    Extracts categories from a summarized output string and returns the cleaned summary and categories.

    The categories are expected to be in the format "Categories: [category1, category2, ...]".

    Args:
        summarized_output (str): The summary text potentially containing categorized question.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the cleaned summary text and a list of categories.
    """
    pass  # Replace with implementation
Breakdown of Changes:
Function Name: Changed from parseCategoriesFromSummary to parse_categories_from_summary to adhere to Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter: Changed the parameter name summarizedOutput to summarized_output to follow Python conventions.
Return Type: Changed the return type from object to dict, as Python typically uses dictionaries to return structured data.
Docstring: Converted the JSDoc-style comments into a Python docstring format, using Args and Returns sections to describe the parameters and return values.
Usage
In Python, you would implement the logic inside the function where the pass statement is currently located. If you have any specific logic or requirements for the implementation, feel free to share, and I can help you further!
