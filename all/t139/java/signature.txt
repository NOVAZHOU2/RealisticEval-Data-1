Here's the Java method signature with comments converted from the provided JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Extracts categories from a summarized output string and returns the cleaned summary and categories.
 * The categories are expected to be in the format "Categories: [category1, category2, ...]".
 *
 * @param summarizedOutput The summary text potentially containing categorized question.
 * @return A Result object containing the cleaned summary text and a list of categories.
 */
public static Result parseCategoriesFromSummary(String summarizedOutput) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This retains the comments and provides the appropriate Java method signature.
