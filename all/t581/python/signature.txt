Here’s how to convert the provided TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while keeping the comments intact:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def abbreviate_number(number: float) -> str:
    """
    Abbreviates a number to a string with a suffix based on its magnitude.
    Suffixes: ["", "k", "M", "B", "T"]
    - 1000 is 'k'
    - 1000000 is 'M'
    - 1000000000 is 'B'

    For example:
        input: 999 output: 999
        input: 1549 output: 1.5k
        input: 1000 output: 1k
        input: 1234567890123 output: 1.2T

    :param number: The number to abbreviate.
    :return: The abbreviated string representation of the number.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of the Converted Code:
Function Name:
Changed from abbreviateNumber (camelCase) to abbreviate_number (snake_case), following Python naming conventions.
Parameters:
The parameter number: float specifies that the function expects a floating-point number, allowing both integers and floats.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated as -> str, meaning the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The docstring contains the original comments, explaining the function’s purpose, the suffixes used, and providing examples of input and output.
Function Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is included to indicate where the function implementation should be added later.
This signature is now suitable for use in your Python code and maintains clarity regarding the function’s behavior and expected input/output.
