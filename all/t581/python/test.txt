Here's how to convert the provided TypeScript Jest test cases into Python's unittest framework. The structure of the tests will be maintained while following Python's syntax and conventions.

    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Converted Code:
Imports:
The unittest module is imported to create unit tests.
The math module should also be imported if the abbreviate_number function is defined in the same file or separately.
Function Definition:
The abbreviate_number function is defined to match the original implementation discussed previously.
Test Class:
A test class TestAbbreviateNumber is created, inheriting from unittest.TestCase.
Test Methods:
Each test case from the TypeScript code is converted to a method in the test class, following the naming convention test_ followed by a description of the test.
The assertion methods (assertEqual, assertIn) are used to verify the output of abbreviate_number against expected results.
Main Block:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block allows the test cases to be run when the script is executed.
How to Run the Tests
You can run these tests by saving the code in a Python file (e.g., test_abbreviate.py) and executing it using the command:
bash
python -m unittest test_abbreviate.py
This will execute all the defined test cases, and you'll see the results in your terminal.
