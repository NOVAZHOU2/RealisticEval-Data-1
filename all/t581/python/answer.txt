Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided TypeScript function abbreviateNumber. The logic and structure of the code have been preserved while adapting it to Python syntax.
Converted Python Code
python
import math

def abbreviate_number(number: float) -> str:
    """
    Abbreviates a number to a string with a suffix based on its magnitude.

    :param number: The number to abbreviate.
    :return: The abbreviated string representation of the number.
    """
    # If the number is less than 1000, return it as is.
    if number < 1000:
        return str(number)

    # Determine the tier of the number based on its magnitude.
    tier = math.floor(math.log10(number) / 3)

    # Define suffixes for each tier.
    suffixes = ["", "k", "M", "B", "T"]

    # Calculate the base number by dividing by the corresponding power of ten.
    base_number = number / (10 ** (tier * 3))

    # Round the base number to one decimal place.
    rounded_number = round(base_number, 1)

    # Return the number with its corresponding suffix.
    return f"{rounded_number}{suffixes[tier]}"
Explanation of the Converted Code:
Imports:
The math module is imported to use the log10 and floor functions.
Function Definition:
The function is defined as abbreviate_number, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
The parameter number is typed as float to allow for both integer and floating-point input.
Docstring:
A docstring describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.
Logic:
The logic checks if the number is less than 1000, returning it as a string if true.
It calculates the tier based on the logarithm of the number.
The suffixes for each tier are defined in a list.
The base number is calculated by dividing the input number by the appropriate power of ten.
The base number is rounded to one decimal place using Python's built-in round function.
Finally, the function returns the formatted string using an f-string.
Example Usage
You can use the function as follows:
python
print(abbreviate_number(950))          # Output: "950"
print(abbreviate_number(1500))         # Output: "1.5k"
print(abbreviate_number(2500000))      # Output: "2.5M"
print(abbreviate_number(9876543210))   # Output: "9.9B"
This will give you the abbreviated string representation of the number based on its magnitude.
