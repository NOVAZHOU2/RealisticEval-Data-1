Here's the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
// Define a custom JSON Encoder for bit sequences.
function BitSequenceEncoder() {
    // No constructor needed for this simple class.
}

// Extend the prototype with a method to handle the encoding process.
BitSequenceEncoder.prototype.encode = function(obj) {
    // Implement the encoding logic here.
};
```

In JavaScript, we don't have a built-in `json.JSONEncoder` like in Python, so we create a custom object with a method named `encode`. This structure allows you to add additional properties or methods as needed to customize the encoding behavior.
