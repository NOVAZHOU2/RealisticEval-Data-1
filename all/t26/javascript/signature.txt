Here is your Python function converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert input strings that contain multiple separators (for example, * ; /) 
 * to comma-separated formatted strings.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The input string containing various separators 
 *                                like *, ;, /, -, :
 * @returns {string} A comma-separated string where all specified separators 
 *                    have been replaced with commas.
 */
function convertToCommaSeparated(inputString) {
    // Replace all occurrences of *, ;, /, -, and : with a comma
    return inputString.replace(/[*;\/\-:]/g, ',');
}
```

This JavaScript function works similarly to your original Python function. It uses a regular expression to replace all instances of `*`, `;`, `/`, `-`, and `:` in the input string with a comma. The `replace` method in JavaScript supports regular expressions, which makes it ideal for tasks like this one. The `g` flag at the end of the regular expression indicates that the replacement should be done globally across the entire string, not just the first occurrence.
