Here is the equivalent Java method signature for your Python function:

```java
/**
 * Converts an input string that contains multiple separators (for example, * ; /) 
 * to a comma-separated formatted string.
 *
 * @param inputString The input string containing various separators like *, ;, /, -, :
 * @return A comma-separated string where all specified separators have been replaced with commas.
 */
public String convertToCommaSeparated(String inputString);
```

Please note that in Java, methods don't specify the type of the `this` pointer or the return type before the method name. Also, Java uses camelCase for method names and it's common practice to start method names with a lowercase letter.
