Here's how you can convert the Python function signature into a Java method signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the maximum width of each column in a two-dimensional array where each sub-array represents a row of table data.
 *
 * @param data A two-dimensional array containing rows of data, where each inner array contains string elements representing the values in each column.
 * @return An array containing the maximum width (in characters) of each column across all rows. The width of a column is defined by the longest string present in that column.
 */
public int[] calculateColumnWidths(String[][] data) {
```

### Explanation:
- **Java does not have built-in support for type hints** like Python, so we use the `String[][]` type to represent a two-dimensional array.
- The return type is changed to `int[]`, which corresponds to the Python `List[int]`.
- The method name remains the same (`calculateColumnWidths`).
- Comments are preserved to maintain clarity and documentation.
