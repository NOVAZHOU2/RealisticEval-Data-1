/**
 * @brief Calculate the maximum width of each column in a table.
 *
 * This function takes a two-dimensional vector representing rows of table data,
 * where each sub-list contains string elements representing the values in each column.
 *
 * @param data A two-dimensional vector containing rows of data.
 *              Each inner vector contains string elements representing the values in each column.
 *
 * @return A vector containing the maximum width (in characters) of each column
 *         across all rows. The width of a column is defined by the longest string
 *         present in that column.
