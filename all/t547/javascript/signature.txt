Here's how you could write this function in JavaScript with equivalent comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the maximum width of each column in a two-dimensional array where each sub-array represents a row of table data.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<string>>} data - A two-dimensional array containing rows of data, where each inner array contains string elements representing the values in each column.
 * @returns {Array<number>} An array containing the maximum width (in characters) of each column across all rows. The width of a column is defined by the longest string present in that column.
 */
function calculateColumnWidths(data) {
    // ...
}
```

Please note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for type hints like Python. However, you can use JSDoc style comments to provide documentation and type information about your functions and their parameters.
