Sure! Here's the TypeScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the maximum width of each column in a list of lists where each sub-list represents a row of table data.
 *
 * @param data - A two-dimensional array containing rows of data, where each inner array contains string elements representing the values in each column.
 * @returns An array containing the maximum width (in characters) of each column across all rows. The width of a column is defined by the longest string present in that column.
 */
function calculateColumnWidths(data: string[][]): number[] {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function signature maintains the same structure and comments as your original Python function.
