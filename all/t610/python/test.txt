Hereâ€™s how to convert the provided Java JUnit test cases into Python unittest test cases. The Python code uses the unittest module, which is the standard testing framework in Python.
Converted Python Code
python
import unittest

class Answer:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.name, self.age))

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if self is other:
            return True
        if not isinstance(other, Answer):
            return False
        return self.name == other.name and self.age == other.age

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hash_code_same_name_and_age(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        self.assertEqual(hash(answer1), hash(answer2), "Hash codes should be equal for the same name and age.")

    def test_hash_code_different_name(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Bob", 25)
        self.assertNotEqual(hash(answer1), hash(answer2), "Hash codes should be different for different names.")

    def test_hash_code_different_age(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Alice", 30)
        self.assertNotEqual(hash(answer1), hash(answer2), "Hash codes should be different for different ages.")

    def test_equals_same_reference(self):
        answer = Answer("Alice", 25)
        self.assertTrue(answer == answer, "An object should be equal to itself.")

    def test_equals_same_name_and_age(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        self.assertTrue(answer1 == answer2, "Two answers with the same name and age should be equal.")

    def test_equals_different_name(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Bob", 25)
        self.assertFalse(answer1 == answer2, "Two answers with different names should not be equal.")

    def test_equals_different_age(self):
        answer1 = Answer("Alice", 25)
        answer2 = Answer("Alice", 30)
        self.assertFalse(answer1 == answer2, "Two answers with different ages should not be equal.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
Explanation of Changes
Imports:
The unittest module is imported to create and run tests.
Class Definition:
The Answer class definition is included to ensure the test class has access to it.
The __hash__ and __eq__ methods are defined to mimic the behavior of Java's hashCode and equals.
Test Class:
The test class TestAnswer inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Each test method is defined with the prefix test_, which is a convention for the unittest framework to recognize test methods.
Assertions:
self.assertEqual(...) is used instead of assertEquals(...) for equality checks.
self.assertNotEqual(...) is used for asserting inequality.
self.assertTrue(...) and self.assertFalse(...) are used to check boolean conditions.
Running the Tests:
The check if __name__ == "__main__": is included to run the tests when the script is executed.
Usage
To run the tests, save the code in a file (e.g., test_answer.py) and execute it. You will see the output indicating which tests passed or failed.
