Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java version of the provided C++ function signature, including Javadoc comments and appropriate type annotations:

```java
/**
 * @brief Counts the number of words in a given string.
 *
 * A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.
 * This method handles leading and trailing whitespace, as well as
 * multiple spaces between words.
 *
 * @param str The input string in which words are to be counted.
 * @return int The count of words in the input string.
 */
public static int countWords(String str) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Javadoc Comments**: Converted the C++ comments to Java-style Javadoc comments using `/** ... */` format.
2. **Method Signature**: The method is declared as `public static int countWords(String str)` to follow Java conventions.
3. **Type Annotations**: The C++ `const std::string &str` is translated to `String str` in Java, as Java strings are reference types by default.

You can fill in the method implementation with the logic as needed. If you want to see the complete implementation with the word counting logic, just let me know!
