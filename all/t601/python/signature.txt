Hereâ€™s the converted C++ code signature into a Python code signature. The C++ comments have been adapted to Python style while retaining their original meaning.
python
def count_words(s: str) -> int:
    """ 
    Count the number of words in a given string.

    A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.
    This function handles leading and trailing whitespace, as well as
    multiple spaces between words.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string in which words are to be counted.

    Returns:
        int: The count of words in the input string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Signature: The C++ function int countWords(const std::string &str) is converted to Python syntax as def count_words(s: str) -> int:.
The parameter str is renamed to s to avoid conflict with Python's built-in str type.
The type hinting in Python is used to indicate that s is a string and the function returns an integer.
Docstring: The C++ comment block is converted into a Python docstring (triple quotes).
The @brief, @param, and @return annotations are replaced with more Pythonic phrases such as "Args" and "Returns".
The description of the function and its behavior is preserved.
Function Body: A placeholder pass statement is included to indicate that the function will be implemented later. This maintains the structure of the code while making it syntactically correct in Python.
This format follows Python conventions for function definitions and documentation, making it clear and easy to understand for Python developers.
