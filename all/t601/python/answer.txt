Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function that counts the number of words in a string. The logic is retained, and comments have been adjusted to fit Python syntax.
python
def count_words(s: str) -> int:
    """Count the number of words in a given string."""
    # Initialize a word count variable
    word_count = 0
    
    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()  # Create a list of words from the input string
    
    # Count each word
    for word in words:
        word_count += 1  # Increment the count for each word found
    
    return word_count  # Return the total word count

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "This is an example string."
    print(f"Number of words: {count_words(sample_text)}")
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition: The function count_words takes a string s as an argument and returns an integer representing the word count.
Comment Adaptation: Comments from the C++ code have been converted to Python-style comments.
Word Count Initialization: A variable word_count is initialized to zero.
Splitting the String: The split() method is used to split the string into words, creating a list of words. This method automatically handles multiple spaces and trims leading/trailing whitespace.
Counting Words: A for loop iterates over the list of words, incrementing the word_count for each word found.
Return Statement: The function returns the total count of words.
Example Usage: A sample usage is provided in a main block to demonstrate how to call the function.
Note
This Python implementation is more concise than the C++ version due to the built-in string handling capabilities of Python. The use of split() simplifies the process of extracting words from the input string.
