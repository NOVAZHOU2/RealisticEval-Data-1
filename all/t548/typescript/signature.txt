Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

/**
 * Reads a text file, wraps its content in JSON brackets, and parses it into a JavaScript object.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The path to the text file to be read.
 * @returns {Promise<any[]>} - A promise that resolves to a list parsed from the JSON content wrapped in brackets.
 * @throws {Error} If the specified file does not exist or the content cannot be parsed as JSON.
 */
async function readTxtAddJsonBracket(filename: string): Promise<any[]> {
    try {
        // Ensure the filename is an absolute path for consistency across different environments
        const absolutePath = path.resolve(filename);

        // Read the contents of the file synchronously
        const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf-8');

        // Wrap the content in JSON brackets and parse it
        const jsonContent = `[${fileContent}]`;
        return JSON.parse(jsonContent);
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            throw new Error(`File not found: ${filename}`);
        } else if (error instanceof SyntaxError) {
            throw new Error(`Invalid JSON format in file: ${filename}`);
        }
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: 
   - `fs` is used for reading files.
   - `path` is used to resolve file paths.

2. **Function Signature**:
   - The function is declared as `async` because we use `fs.readFileSync`, which is synchronous but can be easily converted to asynchronous using `fs.readFile`.

3. **Comments**:
   - Comments are kept the same to maintain clarity.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The function catches errors and throws them with appropriate messages. If the file does not exist (`ENOENT`), it throws a custom error message indicating the file was not found. If there's a syntax error in the JSON parsing, it also provides a custom error message.

5. **JSON Parsing**:
   - The content of the file is wrapped in square brackets `[ ]` before parsing to ensure it is valid JSON.

This TypeScript function should work similarly to your original Python function, handling file reading, JSON wrapping, and error management.
