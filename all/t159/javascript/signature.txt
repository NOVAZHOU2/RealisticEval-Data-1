Here's the JavaScript code signature with the comments retained, converted from your TypeScript version:

```javascript
/**
 * Removes the extension of the given filename and returns the remainder
 *
 * @param {string} file_name - The full name of the file from which to remove the extension.
 * @returns {string} The file name without the extension. If no extension is found, returns the original file name.
 */
function removeFileExtension(file_name) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This keeps the comments intact while removing the TypeScript-specific type annotations.
