TypeScript Code Signature
typescript

Converted Python Code Signature
python
def remove_file_extension(file_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes the extension of the given filename and returns the remainder.

    Args:
        file_name (str): The full name of the file from which to remove the extension.

    Returns:
        str: The file name without the extension. If no extension is found, returns the original file name.

Breakdown of the Conversion
Function Definition:
The function is defined using the def keyword in Python, followed by the function name remove_file_extension.
Parameter Annotation:
The parameter file_name is annotated with its type str, indicating that it should be a string.
Return Annotation:
The return type is specified as -> str, indicating that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are converted into a docstring using triple quotes ("""). The docstring includes a description of the function, the arguments, and the return value.
Implementation Placeholder:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the actual implementation, indicating that this is a stub and should be filled in later.
This Python signature mirrors the TypeScript version in terms of functionality and documentation style.
