Sure! Hereâ€™s how to convert the provided TypeScript function into Python while retaining the comments and functionality.
TypeScript Code
typescript
/**
 * Removes the extension of the given filename and returns the remainder
 *
 * @param {string} file_name - The full name of the file from which to remove the extension.
 * @returns {string} The file name without the extension. If no extension is found, returns the original file name.
 */
function removeFileExtension(file_name: string): string {
    // Find the index of the last dot in the file name
    const lastDotIndex = file_name.lastIndexOf('.');
    // If a dot is found and it is not the first character
    if (lastDotIndex !== -1) {
        // Return the substring from the beginning to the last dot
        return file_name.slice(0, lastDotIndex);
    }
    // Return the original file name if no dot is found
    return file_name;
}
Converted Python Code
python
def remove_file_extension(file_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes the extension of the given filename and returns the remainder.

    Args:
        file_name (str): The full name of the file from which to remove the extension.

    Returns:
        str: The file name without the extension. If no extension is found, returns the original file name.
    """
    # Find the index of the last dot in the file name
    last_dot_index = file_name.rfind('.')
    
    # If a dot is found and it is not the first character
    if last_dot_index != -1:
        # Return the substring from the beginning to the last dot
        return file_name[:last_dot_index]
    
    # Return the original file name if no dot is found
    return file_name
Breakdown of the Python Code
Function Definition:
The function remove_file_extension is defined with a parameter file_name of type str, returning a str.
Docstring:
A docstring is added to describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, and return values, similar to the comments in the TypeScript code.
Finding Last Dot Index:
The lastDotIndex variable in TypeScript is replaced with last_dot_index using rfind('.'), which returns the highest index of the specified substring (the last dot in this case). If no dot is found, it returns -1.
Conditional Check:
The conditional check (if last_dot_index != -1) remains the same. It checks if a dot was found in the filename.
Returning the Result:
If a dot is found, the substring before the dot is returned using slicing (file_name[:last_dot_index]).
If no dot is found, the original filename is returned.
This Python function provides the same functionality as the original TypeScript code, effectively removing the file extension if it exists.
