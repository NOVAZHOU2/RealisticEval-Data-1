Here's the Java code signature with the comments retained:

```java
/**
 * Removes the extension of the given filename and returns the remainder.
 *
 * @param fileName - The full name of the file from which to remove the extension.
 * @return The file name without the extension. If no extension is found, returns the original file name.
 */
public static String removeFileExtension(String fileName) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the original comments while adapting the signature for Java.
