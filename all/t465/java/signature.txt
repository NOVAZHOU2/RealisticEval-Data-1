Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the given Python function, including proper Java-style comments and Javadoc documentation. The Java code will use a simple implementation to perform matrix-vector multiplication without relying on external libraries like NumPy.

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * This class provides methods for matrix and vector operations.
 */
public class Answer {

    /**
     * Multiplies a given matrix by a vector.
     *
     * @param matrix A 2D array (matrix) of shape (m, n) where m is the number of rows
     *               and n is the number of columns.
     * @param vector A 1D array (vector) of shape (n,) that represents a vector
     *               compatible for multiplication with the given matrix.
     * @return A 1D array (resulting vector) of shape (m,) representing the product of
     *         the matrix and the vector.
     */
    public static double[] matrixVectorMultiplication(double[][] matrix, double[] vector) {
        // Validate the dimensions of the matrix and vector
        if (matrix == null || vector == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length != vector.length) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Matrix columns and vector size must match.");
        }

        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;

        // Initialize the result vector
        double[] result = new double[rows];

        // Perform matrix-vector multiplication
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                result[i] += matrix[i][j] * vector[j];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    /**
     * Main method to demonstrate the usage of the matrixVectorMultiplication method.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        double[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6}
        };
        double[] vector = {7, 8, 9};

        double[] result = matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector);
        System.out.println("Resulting vector:");
        for (double val : result) {
            System.out.println(val);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package and Class**: The code is organized within the `org.real.temp` package and the `Answer` class.
- **Javadoc Documentation**: The `matrixVectorMultiplication` method is documented using JavaDoc comments, providing detailed explanations of parameters and return values.
- **Type Declarations**: The method parameters are declared as `double[][]` for the matrix and `double[]` for the vector.
- **Validation**: The method checks if the matrix and vector are valid and compatible for multiplication.
- **Multiplication Logic**: Nested loops are used to compute the dot product of each row of the matrix with the vector.
- **Example Usage**: The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `matrixVectorMultiplication` method with example data and prints the resulting vector.
