Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
const math = require('mathjs');

/**
 * Multiplies a given matrix by a vector using mathjs's multiply function.
 * 
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A 2D array (matrix) of shape (m, n) where m is the number of rows
 *                                        and n is the number of columns.
 * @param {Array<number>} vector - A 1D array (vector) of shape (n,) that represents a vector
 *                                 compatible for multiplication with the given matrix.
 * @returns {Array<number>} - A 1D array (resulting vector) of shape (m,) representing the product of
 *                            the matrix and the vector.
 */
function matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector) {
    // Perform matrix-vector multiplication using the multiply function.
    const result = math.multiply(matrix, vector);

    // Return the resulting vector from the multiplication.
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
const vector = [5, 6];

const result = matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector);
console.log(result); // Output should be [17, 39]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Statement**: The `mathjs` library is imported at the beginning.
2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The function signature is documented using JSDoc format.
   - The parameters and return types are clearly defined.
3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The `matrixVectorMultiplication` function takes a matrix and a vector as inputs.
   - It uses the `math.multiply` function from `mathjs` to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.
   - The result is returned.

This ensures that the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code are preserved in JavaScript, along with proper documentation using JSDoc.
