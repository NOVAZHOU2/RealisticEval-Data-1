Sure, I can help you convert the given Python code to JavaScript. The Python code uses NumPy for matrix and vector operations. In JavaScript, we can use a library like TensorFlow.js or math.js, but for simplicity, I'll use a basic approach with arrays and loops.

Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
function matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
            sum += matrix[i][j] * vector[j];
        }
        result.push(sum);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This function takes a matrix (2D array) and a vector (1D array) as inputs and returns the result of multiplying the matrix by the vector.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the resulting vector.
2. Iterate over each row in the matrix.
3. For each row, initialize a variable `sum` to accumulate the dot product of the row and the vector.
4. Within the inner loop, multiply the corresponding elements of the row and the vector and add them to `sum`.
5. After completing the inner loop for a row, push the accumulated `sum` into the `result` array.
6. Return the `result` array after all rows have been processed.

You can test this function with some sample data to ensure it works correctly.
