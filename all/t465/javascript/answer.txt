Sure, I can help you convert the given Python code to JavaScript. The Python code uses NumPy for matrix-vector multiplication. In JavaScript, we can use a library like TensorFlow.js or math.js for similar operations. For this example, I will use math.js because it provides a simpler and more direct approach.

First, you need to install `mathjs` if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install mathjs
```

Here is the equivalent JavaScript code using `mathjs`:

```javascript
const math = require('mathjs');

function matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector) {
    const result = math.multiply(matrix, vector);
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
const vector = [5, 6];

const result = matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector);
console.log(result); // Output should be [17, 39]
```

In this JavaScript code:
- We import the `mathjs` library.
- The `matrixVectorMultiplication` function takes a matrix and a vector as inputs.
- It uses the `math.multiply` function from `mathjs` to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.
- The result is returned.

Make sure to include the `mathjs` library in your project by installing it via npm as shown above.
