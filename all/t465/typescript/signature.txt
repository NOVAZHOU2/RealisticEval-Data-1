Certainly! Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code, including the necessary imports and JSDoc-style documentation:

1. Install `mathjs` if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   npm install mathjs
   ```

2. Convert the Python code to TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as math from 'mathjs';

/**
 * Multiplies a given matrix by a vector using mathjs's matrix multiplication.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 2D array (matrix) of shape (m, n) where m is the number of rows
 *                 and n is the number of columns.
 * @param vector - A 1D array (vector) of shape (n,) that represents a vector
 *                 compatible for multiplication with the given matrix.
 * @returns A 1D array (resulting vector) of shape (m,) representing the product of
 *          the matrix and the vector.
 */
function matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix: number[][], vector: number[]): number[] {
    // Perform matrix-vector multiplication using the multiply function from mathjs.
    const result = math.multiply(matrix, vector);

    // Return the resulting vector from the multiplication.
    return result;
}

// Example usage
const matrix: number[][] = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

const vector: number[] = [1, 0, 1];

const result = matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix, vector);
console.log(result); // Output will be the result of the matrix-vector multiplication
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: 
   - Import `mathjs` for matrix and vector operations.

2. **Types**:
   - Define `matrix` as a 2D array of numbers (`number[][]`).
   - Define `vector` as a 1D array of numbers (`number[]`).

3. **Documentation**:
   - Use JSDoc-style comments to document the function, parameters, and return type.

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - Use `math.multiply` from `mathjs` to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - Provide an example to demonstrate how to call the function with a sample matrix and vector.

This conversion preserves the original functionality and structure while adapting it to TypeScript's static type system and using `mathjs` for matrix operations.
