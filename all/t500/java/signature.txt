Sure, here is the Java version of your Python function with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts the string representation of a score to its decimal value.
 * For example:
 *     input: "10/4"
 *     output: 2.5
 *
 * @param scoreStr The score as a string, can be a decimal or a fraction
 * @return The decimal value of the score as a double, or null if the input is invalid
 */
public Double convertScoreToDecimal(String scoreStr) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, it's common to use `Double` instead of `float` for decimal numbers and return `null` when the input is invalid. Adjust the implementation inside the method according to your needs.
