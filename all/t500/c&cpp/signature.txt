Certainly! Below is the C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Converts the string representation of a score to its decimal value.
 * For example:
 *     input: "10/4"
 *     output: 2.5
 *
 * @param scoreStr The score as a string, can be a decimal or a fraction
 * @return The decimal value of the score as a double, or -1.0 if the input is invalid
 */
double convertScoreToDecimal(const std::string& scoreStr);
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Name:** `convertScoreToDecimal`
- **Parameters:** 
  - `scoreStr` (const std::string&): The score as a string, can be a decimal or a fraction.
- **Return Type:** `double`: The decimal value of the score as a double, or `-1.0` if the input is invalid.
- **Comments:** The comments are preserved to explain the functionality and usage of the function.

This C++ function signature follows the style commonly used in C++ for documenting functions, making it clear what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
