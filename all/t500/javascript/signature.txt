Here's how you would write that function in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts the string representation of a score to its decimal value.
 * For example:
 *      input: "10/4"
 *      output: 2.5
 * @param {string} scoreStr - The score as a string, can be a decimal or a fraction
 * @returns {number | null} The decimal value of the score as a number, or null if the input is invalid
 */
function convertScoreToDecimal(scoreStr) {
    
}
```

This JavaScript function signature follows the same structure and comments as your Python version. However, note that JavaScript does not have type annotations like Python, so we use JSDoc style comments to describe the types of parameters and return values.
