Here is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided Python function:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Converts numeric values in a CSV row from string format to a standardized format.
 *
 * @param row A map representing a row of CSV data where keys are column names and values are strings.
 * @return A new map with values converted:
 *         - Numeric strings have commas replaced with dots.
 *         - Non-numeric strings are set to null.
 */
public Map<String, String> convertCsvValues(Map<String, String> row) {
```

This Java method has the same purpose as the Python function `convert_csv_values`. It takes a `Map<String, String>` as an argument, which represents a row of CSV data, and returns a new `Map<String, String>` with the numeric values converted according to the specified rules. The Java method includes Javadoc comments that describe the method's purpose, parameters, and return value, similar to the Python docstring.
