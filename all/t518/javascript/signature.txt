Here is your Python code signature translated into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert numeric values in a CSV row from string format to a standardized format.
 *
 * @param {Object} row - An object representing a row of CSV data where
 *                        keys are column names and values are strings.
 *
 * @returns {Object} - A new object with values converted:
 *                      - Numeric strings have commas replaced with dots.
 *                      - Non-numeric strings are set to null.
 */
```

Please note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for type hinting like Python, but it uses JSDoc comments for documentation purposes which serve a similar purpose. The `Optional` type from Python is represented as `null` or `undefined` in JavaScript.
