Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java method signature for the provided Python function `safe_format`, along with the necessary comments:

```java
/**
 * Safely formats a template string by replacing placeholders with corresponding values
 * from the provided keyword arguments. If a placeholder does not have a corresponding
 * value in kwargs, it remains unchanged.
 *
 * @param template The string template containing placeholders in the form {key}.
 * @param kwargs   Keyword arguments that map keys to their replacement values.
 * @return The formatted string with placeholders replaced by values.
 */
public static String safeFormat(String template, Map<String, Object> kwargs) {
```

### Explanation:
- **@param template**: This annotation describes the first parameter of the method, which is the template string.
- **@param kwargs**: This annotation describes the second parameter of the method, which is a `Map` containing key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values can be of any object type (`Object`).
- **@return**: This annotation specifies the return type of the method, which is a `String`.

This Java method signature should provide the same functionality as the original Python function, ensuring that placeholders in the template string are replaced with corresponding values from the `kwargs` map. If a placeholder does not have a corresponding value in the map, it will remain unchanged in the returned string.
