Here's the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert a time duration string in the format 'XhYminZs' to milliseconds.
 *
 * This function takes a string representing a time duration, where hours, minutes, and seconds
 * are optionally provided, and converts this duration into the equivalent number of milliseconds.
 *
 * @param {string} timeStr - A string representing the time duration, e.g., '1h20min30s'.
 * @returns {number | null} - The equivalent duration in milliseconds, or null if the input is invalid.
 */
function convertHmsToMilliseconds(timeStr) {
```

This JavaScript function uses JSDoc syntax for its documentation comments, which is similar to Python's docstrings. It specifies that the function takes a single argument `timeStr` of type `string`, and returns either a `number` or `null`.
