Here's the equivalent Python code signature based on your provided C++ code. The comments have been converted to Python-style comments.
python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.data = value  # Data held by the node
        self.next = None   # Pointer to the next node in the list

# LinkedList class definition
class LinkedList:
    # Method to add a node at the beginning of the list
    def insert_at_head(self, value):
        pass

    # Method to add a node at the end of the list
    def insert_at_tail(self, value):
        pass

    # Method to delete a node with a specific value
    def delete_value(self, value):
        pass

    # Method to search for a value in the list
    def search(self, value):
        pass

    # Method to print all elements in the list
    def print_list(self):
        pass
In this Python version:
The Node class has an __init__ method for initialization, similar to the C++ constructor.
The method names in the LinkedList class have been converted to snake_case, which is the standard naming convention in Python.
