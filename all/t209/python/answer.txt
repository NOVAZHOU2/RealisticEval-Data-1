Sure! Hereâ€™s a Python version of the C++ linked list implementation you provided. The code maintains the same functionality, including methods for inserting at the head and tail, deleting a value, searching for a value, and printing the list.

    print(linked_list.search(30))  # Output: True
    print(linked_list.search(10))  # Output: False
Explanation
Node Class: Represents a single node in the linked list, containing data and a pointer to the next node (next).
LinkedList Class: Represents the linked list itself, containing:
A pointer to the head of the list (head).
Methods to manipulate the list:
insert_at_head(value): Adds a new node with the specified value at the beginning.
insert_at_tail(value): Adds a new node with the specified value at the end.
delete_value(value): Deletes the first node found with the specified value.
search(value): Searches for a node with the specified value, returning True if found and False otherwise.
print_list(): Prints the values of all nodes in the list.
Destructor (__del__): Cleans up memory by deleting nodes when the linked list is no longer in use.
Example Usage: Demonstrates how to use the LinkedList class.
