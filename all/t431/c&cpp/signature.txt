Sure, here's the equivalent C++ function signature for your Python function:

```cpp
/**
 * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by a struct Rect with members:
 * - x1, y1: Coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - x2, y2: Coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by a Rect struct.
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by a Rect struct.
 * @return true if the rectangles intersect horizontally, false otherwise.
 */
bool intersectHorizontally(const struct Rect& rect1, const struct Rect& rect2);
```

And here's an example of how you might define the `Rect` struct in C++:

```cpp
struct Rect {
    int x1;
    int y1;
    int x2;
    int y2;
};
```

This C++ function signature and struct definition should serve the same purpose as your original Python function.
