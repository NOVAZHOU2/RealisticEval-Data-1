Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Determines if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 * 
 * Each rectangle is defined by a tuple [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * 
 * @param rect1 - The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param rect2 - The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @returns True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, False otherwise.
 */
function intersectHorizontally(rect1: [number, number, number, number], rect2: [number, number, number, number]): boolean {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function preserves the original functionality and structure, including the type annotations and documentation comments. Note that tuples in TypeScript are represented using square brackets with the types of each element specified, similar to how they are defined in the Python code.
