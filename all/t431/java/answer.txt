Here's the equivalent Java code for your Python function:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    
    /**
     * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
     *
     * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
     * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
     * @return true if the rectangles intersect horizontally, false otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean intersectHorizontally(int[] rect1, int[] rect2) {
        // Check if the rectangles intersect horizontally
        return Math.max(rect1[0], rect2[0]) < Math.min(rect1[2], rect2[2]);
    }
}
```

In this Java version, I've used an array to represent each rectangle instead of a tuple, since arrays are more commonly used in Java for such purposes. The `intersectHorizontally` method takes two integer arrays representing the rectangles and returns a boolean indicating whether they intersect horizontally.
