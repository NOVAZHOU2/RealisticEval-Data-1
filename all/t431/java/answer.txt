Hereâ€™s the Java version of the provided Python code, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. The method `intersectHorizontally` will be defined to determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally. The rectangles are represented as arrays of integers to maintain simplicity and consistency with the original Python code.

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Determines if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
     * 
     * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
     * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
     * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
     * 
     * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
     * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
     * @return true if the rectangles intersect horizontally, false otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean intersectHorizontally(int[] rect1, int[] rect2) {
        return !(rect1[2] < rect2[0] || rect2[2] < rect1[0]);
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] rect1 = {1, 1, 3, 3};
        int[] rect2 = {2, 2, 4, 4};
        
        System.out.println(intersectHorizontally(rect1, rect2)); // Expected output: true
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package Declaration**: `package org.real.temp;` declares the package name.
- **Class Definition**: `public class Answer` defines the class name.
- **Method Signature**: `public static boolean intersectHorizontally(int[] rect1, int[] rect2)` defines the method to check horizontal intersection between two rectangles.
- **Logic**: The method checks if the right boundary of one rectangle is to the left of the left boundary of the other rectangle, which indicates no horizontal intersection.
- **Main Method**: An example usage is provided in the `main` method to demonstrate how to call the `intersectHorizontally` method.

This Java code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original Python code but adapts it to Java's syntax and conventions.
