Here's how you can translate the Python function signature into Java:

```java
/**
 * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @return true if the rectangles intersect horizontally, false otherwise.
 */
```

In Java, arrays are used instead of tuples for passing multiple values. Also, Java uses `@param` and `@return` tags in Javadoc comments to document method parameters and return type respectively.
