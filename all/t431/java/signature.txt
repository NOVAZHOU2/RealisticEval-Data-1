Sure, here is the equivalent Java method with appropriate comments and structure:

```java
/**
 * Determines if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 * 
 * Each rectangle is defined by a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), where:
 * - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * 
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * @return True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, False otherwise.
 */
public static boolean intersectHorizontally(int[] rect1, int[] rect2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this translation:
- The Python function `intersect_horizontally` becomes a Java static method `intersectHorizontally`.
- The parameters `rect1` and `rect2`, which were tuples in Python, are now arrays of integers (`int[]`) in Java.
- The docstring is converted into a Javadoc comment block, and the parameter and return descriptions are formatted accordingly.
