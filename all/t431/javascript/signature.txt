Here's how you can convert your Python function into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an object {x1, y1, x2, y2}, where:
 * - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param {Object} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @param {Object} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, false otherwise.
 */
function intersectHorizontally(rect1, rect2) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

In JavaScript, we use objects instead of tuples for representing rectangles and `//` instead of `"""` for single-line comments. Also, the docstring format used in JavaScript is slightly different from Python's triple-quote style.
