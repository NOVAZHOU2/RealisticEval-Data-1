Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param {Array} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param {Array} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, False otherwise.
 */
function intersectHorizontally(rect1, rect2) {
    return !(rect1[2] < rect2[0] || rect2[2] < rect1[0]);
}
```

This JavaScript function preserves the purpose and structure of the original Python function, including the comments rewritten in JSDoc format.
