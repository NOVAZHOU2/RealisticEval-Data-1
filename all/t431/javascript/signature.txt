Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Determine if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
 * 
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * 
 * @param {Array} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param {Array} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @returns {boolean} True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, False otherwise.
 */
function intersectHorizontally(rect1, rect2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note that the function name has been changed to `intersectHorizontally` to follow camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript. The tuples in Python have been converted to arrays in JavaScript since JavaScript does not have a native tuple type.
