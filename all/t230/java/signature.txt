Here is the equivalent Java method signature for your Python function:

```java
/**
 * Move the emoj expression in the string to the end of the text
 *
 * @param text The input string containing text and possibly emojis.
 * @return The modified string with all emojis moved to the end.
 */
public String moveEmojisToEnd(String text) {
```

This method signature keeps the same functionality and parameters as your original Python function, but it's written in Java.
