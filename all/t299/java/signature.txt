Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code with the same functionality and comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the age from the given birth date string and returns a string containing the original birth date and the calculated age. 
 * If the entered date string is invalid or empty, the function returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param birthDateString - The birth date as a string in a recognizable date format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD').
 * @return A string that includes the original birth date and the calculated age in the format 'birthDateString (age)', 
 *         or an empty string if the input is invalid.
 */
public String calculateAge(String birthDateString) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Please note that you would need to implement the logic inside the `calculateAge` method to handle the calculation of age based on the provided birth date string.
