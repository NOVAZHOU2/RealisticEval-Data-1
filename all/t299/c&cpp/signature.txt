Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the age from the given birth date string and returns a string containing the original birth date and the calculated age. 
 * If the entered date string is invalid or empty, the function returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param birthDateString - The birth date as a string in a recognizable date format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD').
 * @return std::string - A string that includes the original birth date and the calculated age in the format 'birthDateString (age)', 
 *                      or an empty string if the input is invalid.
 */
std::string calculateAge(const std::string& birthDateString);
```

This C++ function signature follows similar conventions to the JavaScript version, including parameter types and return type annotations, while preserving the purpose of the function and its documentation.
