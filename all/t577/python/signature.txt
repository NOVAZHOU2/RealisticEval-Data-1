Here's how you can convert the TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while keeping the comments intact:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def format_post_count(count: int) -> str:
    """
    Formats the post count into a human-readable string.
    
    For example:
        input: 3 output: 02 Posts
        input: 1 output: 01 Post

    :param count: The number of posts.
    :return: A formatted string indicating the number of posts.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
Changed formatPostCount to format_post_count, following Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Parameters:
count: int specifies that the parameter count is expected to be of type integer.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated as -> str, meaning the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The original comments are preserved in the docstring format, which is standard for Python documentation.
It includes descriptions of the function's purpose, example input and output, and details on the parameter and return value.
Function Implementation:
A pass statement is included to indicate where the function implementation should be added later.
You can now use this code signature in your Python program.
