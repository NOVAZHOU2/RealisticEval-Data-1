Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided TypeScript function into Python code while keeping the original functionality intact.
Converted Python Code
python
def format_post_count(count: int) -> str:
    """
    Formats the post count into a human-readable string.

    :param count: The number of posts.
    :return: A formatted string indicating the number of posts.
    """
    if count == 0:
        return "No Posts"
    else:
        post_count = str(count).zfill(2)  # Ensure at least two digits
        post_word = "Post" if count == 1 else "Posts"  # Singular or plural
        return f"{post_count} {post_word}"  # Correctly formatted string

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(format_post_count(0))   # Output: No Posts
    print(format_post_count(1))   # Output: 01 Post
    print(format_post_count(5))   # Output: 05 Posts
Explanation of the Converted Code:
Function Definition:
The function is named format_post_count, following Python's naming convention (snake_case).
The parameter type is defined as count: int, indicating that count should be an integer.
The return type is specified as -> str, indicating that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
A docstring is added to describe the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value, similar to the TypeScript comments.
Logic Implementation:
The logic of checking if count is 0 remains the same. If true, it returns "No Posts".
The post_count variable uses str(count).zfill(2) to ensure that the string representation of the count has at least two digits, similar to the TypeScript padStart.
The conditional expression post_word is used to determine whether to use "Post" or "Posts".
Formatted Return:
The return statement uses an f-string to format the output, which is the Python equivalent of the template literal used in TypeScript.
Example Usage:
An example usage section is provided to demonstrate how the function works. This section is wrapped in a __main__ block to allow for standalone execution.
You can run this Python code directly in your environment, and it will behave as expected, formatting the post count into a human-readable string.
