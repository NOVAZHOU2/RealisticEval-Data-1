Here's how you can translate the TypeScript Jest test cases into C++ using Catch2:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <string>

// Assume formatPostCount function is declared here

TEST_CASE("formatPostCount", "[formatPostCount]") {
    REQUIRE(formatPostCount(1) == "01 Post");
    REQUIRE(formatPostCount(2) == "02 Posts");
    REQUIRE(formatPostCount(10) == "10 Posts");
    REQUIRE(formatPostCount(99) == "99 Posts");
    REQUIRE(formatPostCount(5) == "05 Posts");
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each `TEST_CASE` represents a suite of tests for the `formatPostCount` function.
- `REQUIRE` is used for assertions, similar to `expect` in Jest. If the condition is false, the test will fail.
- Make sure to include the implementation of `formatPostCount` before the test cases.
