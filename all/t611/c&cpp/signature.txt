Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature along with the comments converted from the provided Python code:

```cpp
#include <string>

/* 
 * Generates a random string of length 25 containing both upper case (A-Z) 
 * and lower case (a-z) letters.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    std::string: A randomly generated string that meets the criteria of 
 *    including both upper and lower case letters.
 */
std::string generate_random_string();
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The return type `str` in Python is translated to `std::string` in C++.

2. **Comments**: The docstring has been converted into a C++ style comment using `/* ... */`, clearly describing the function's purpose and return value.

3. **Include Directive**: An `#include <string>` directive is added to include the necessary library for using `std::string`. 

This signature provides the same clarity and purpose as the original Python function.
