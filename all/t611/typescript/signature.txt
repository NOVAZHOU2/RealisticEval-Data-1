Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature with appropriate documentation comments and type annotations:

```typescript
/**
 * Generates a random string of length 25 containing both upper case (A-Z) 
 * and lower case (a-z) letters.
 *
 * @returns {string} A randomly generated string that meets the criteria of 
 * including both upper and lower case letters.
 */
function generateRandomString(): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the original functionality and structure while converting the comments to the TypeScript style.
