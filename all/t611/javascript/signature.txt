Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Generates a random string of length 25 containing both upper case (A-Z) and lower case (a-z) letters.
 *
 * @returns {string} A randomly generated string that meets the criteria of including both upper and lower case letters.
 */
function generateRandomString() {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function name is converted to camelCase to align with JavaScript conventions.
- The comment is reformatted using JSDoc standards for clarity and documentation purposes.
