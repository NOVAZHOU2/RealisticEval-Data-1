Here's the JavaScript equivalent for the Python code signature:

```javascript
/**
 * Implements Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
 * in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number | Infinity>>} adjacencyMatrix - The adjacency matrix representing the graph,
 * where adjacencyMatrix[i][j] is the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is
 * no edge, the weight should be represented as Infinity.
 *
 * @returns {Array<Array<number | Infinity>>} - The matrix representing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
 * shortestPaths[i][j] will hold the shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j.
 */
function floydWarshallShortestPaths(adjacencyMatrix) {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

In JavaScript, we don't have explicit type declarations like `typing` in Python. However, we use JSDoc comments to document the types and behavior of our functions. The `@param` tag is used to describe function parameters, their types, and descriptions. Similarly, the `@returns` tag is used to describe the return value of the function.
