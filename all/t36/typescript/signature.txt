Here's how you can convert your Python function signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Implements Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
 * in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
 *
 * @param adjacencyMatrix - The adjacency matrix representing the graph,
 * where adjacencyMatrix[i][j] is the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is
 * no edge, the weight should be represented as Infinity.
 *
 * @returns The matrix representing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
 * shortestPaths[i][j] will hold the shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j.
 */
function floydWarshallShortestPaths(adjacencyMatrix: number[][]): number[][] {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

This TypeScript version maintains the same functionality and documentation as your original Python function. Note that in TypeScript, `float('inf')` is replaced with `Infinity`.
