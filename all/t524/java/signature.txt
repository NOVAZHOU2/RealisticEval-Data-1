Here is the Java equivalent of your Python function signature:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    
    /**
     * Scale the point cloud by a given factor.
     *
     * @param pointCloud A double[][] representing the 3D point cloud.
     * @param scaleFactor A double representing the scaling factor.
     * @return A double[][] of the scaled point cloud.
     */
    public static double[][] scalePointCloud(double[][] pointCloud, double scaleFactor) {
        int n = pointCloud.length;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<3; j++) {
                pointCloud[i][j] *= scaleFactor;
            }
        }
        return pointCloud;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the function here...
    }
}
```

This Java method does not return a new `double[][]`, it modifies the input `pointCloud` in place. This is because arrays in Java are passed by reference. If you want to keep the original `pointCloud` unchanged and return a new one, you would need to create a copy of the input array before modifying it.
