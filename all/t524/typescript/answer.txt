Sure, here is how you can convert your Python function to TypeScript:

```typescript
function scalePointCloud(pointCloud: number[][], scaleFactor: number): number[][] {
    /*
    Scale the point cloud by a given factor.

    Args:
        pointCloud (number[][]): A N x 3 array representing the 3D point cloud.
        scaleFactor (number): A number representing the scaling factor.

    Returns:
        number[][]: A N x 3 array of the scaled point cloud.
    */
    
    return pointCloud.map(point => point.map(coord => coord * scaleFactor));
}
```

Please note that in TypeScript, arrays are not the same as numpy arrays. This means we have to manually apply the scaling operation on each coordinate in each point. Also, TypeScript does not support dynamic typing like Python's numpy arrays, so we need to explicitly specify the type for each parameter and the return value.
