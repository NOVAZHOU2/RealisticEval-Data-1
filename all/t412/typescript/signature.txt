Sure! Please provide the specific Python code snippet you want converted to TypeScript, including any function signatures, class definitions, comments, and docstrings. I'll help you translate it into equivalent TypeScript code with proper type annotations and JSDoc comments. 

If you could share the Python code snippet, I can get started on the conversion. Hereâ€™s an example of what the Python code might look like:

```python
def format_text(input_file: str = 'input.txt', output_file: str = 'output.txt') -> None:
    """
    Formats the text by removing newline characters and adding spaces between lines.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input file. Defaults to 'input.txt'.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file. Defaults to 'output.txt'.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        # Open the input file in read mode
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            # Read the content of the input file line by line
            lines = f.readlines()

        # Process each line
        processed_lines = []
        for line in lines:
            # Remove newline characters and add a space
            processed_line = line.rstrip('\n')
            processed_lines.append(processed_line)  # Append the processed line

        # Join the processed lines with spaces
        content_without_newlines = ' '.join(processed_lines)

        # Open the output file in write mode
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            # Write the content without newlines to the output file
            f.write(content_without_newlines)

        print("Line breaks removed and spaces added. Output written to", output_file)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Input file not found.")
```

Please confirm if this is the Python code you want converted, or provide your own snippet.
