Sure! Please provide the specific Python code snippet you would like me to convert into Java. This will help me ensure that I capture all the details accurately and preserve the original functionality and structure. Hereâ€™s an example Python code snippet for reference:

```python
def format_text(input_file: str = 'input.txt', output_file: str = 'output.txt') -> None:
    """
    Formats the text by removing newline characters and adding spaces between lines.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input file. Defaults to 'input.txt'.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file. Defaults to 'output.txt'.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            lines = f.readlines()

        processed_lines = []
        for line in lines:
            processed_line = line.rstrip('\n')
            processed_lines.append(processed_line)

        content_without_newlines = ' '.join(processed_lines)

        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content_without_newlines)

        print("Line breaks removed and spaces added. Output written to", output_file)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Input file not found.")
```

Please provide the Python code snippet you want converted, and I will translate it into Java with appropriate Javadoc comments and structure.
