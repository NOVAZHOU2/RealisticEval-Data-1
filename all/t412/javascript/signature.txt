Sure, I can help you convert the Python code signature to JavaScript code signature while keeping the comments intact. However, since you haven't provided the actual Python code, I'll demonstrate how you might convert a simple function signature from Python to JavaScript.

Here's an example of a Python function signature:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b
```

The equivalent JavaScript code signature would look like this:

```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers and returns the result.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

If you provide the specific Python code you want to convert, I can give you the exact JavaScript version with the same comments.
