Here's the C++ code signature for the given Python function:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Removes comments from the provided string. Comments start with a '#' and end at the newline.
 * For example:
 *     input: Hello, world! # This is a comment
 *     output:  Hello, world!
 *
 * @param string The input string containing potential comments.
 * @return The string with all comments removed.
 */
std::string remove_comments(const std::string& string);
```

This C++ code signature follows the same structure and includes the necessary `#include` directive for the `std::string` class, as well as a docstring that matches the original Python function's comments.
