Here's how you can write the equivalent TypeScript function for your Python code:

```typescript
function removeComments(inputString: string): string {
    // Use regular expression to match lines starting with '#'
    return inputString.replace(/#.*/g, '');
}

// Example usage:
const result = removeComments("Hello, world! # This is a comment");
console.log(result);  // Output: "Hello, world!"
```

### Explanation:
- **Regular Expression (`/#.*/g`)**: 
  - `#`: Matches the literal character `#`.
  - `. *`: Matches any character (except line terminators) zero or more times.
  - `g`: Global flag that matches all occurrences in the string.
  
This will replace all lines that start with `#` and everything following it with an empty string, effectively removing comments from the input string.
