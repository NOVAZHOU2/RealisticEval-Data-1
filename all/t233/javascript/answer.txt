Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code that maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the provided Python code:

```javascript
function removeComments(string) {
    /**
     * Removes comments from the provided string. Comments start with a '#' and end at the newline.
     *
     * @param {string} string - The input string containing potential comments.
     * @returns {string} The string with all comments removed.
     */
    const lines = string.split('\n');  // Split the string into lines
    const cleanedLines = lines.map(line => line.split('#')[0]);  // Remove the comment part from each line
    return cleanedLines.join('\n');  // Join the lines back into a single string
}
```

This JavaScript function `removeComments` performs the same operations as the Python function `remove_comments`. It splits the input string into lines, removes any text after a `#` symbol from each line, and then joins the cleaned lines back into a single string.
