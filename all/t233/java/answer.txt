Here's how you can translate your Python function into Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Removes comments from the provided string. Comments start with a '#' and end at the newline.
     * For example:
     *      input: Hello, world! # This is a comment
     *      output:  Hello, world!
     *
     * @param string The input string containing potential comments.
     * @return The string with all comments removed.
     */
    public static String removeComments(String string) {
        return string.replaceAll("#.*", "");
    }

}
```

In this Java code, I used the `replaceAll` method of the `String` class to replace everything from a `#` symbol until the end of the line (`\n`) with nothing. Note that `\n` is represented as `\\n` in Java strings because backslashes need to be escaped. Also note that in Java, methods must belong to a class, so I placed the `removeComments` method inside the `Answer` class.
