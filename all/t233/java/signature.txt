Sure, here's how you can convert the Python function signature to Java:

```java
/**
 * Removes comments from the provided string. Comments start with a '#' and end at the newline.
 * For example:
 *      input: Hello, world! # This is a comment
 *      output:  Hello, world!
 * 
 * @param string The input string containing potential comments.
 * @return The string with all comments removed.
 */
public String removeComments(String string) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your original Python function.
