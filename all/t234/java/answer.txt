Here is your Python function converted into Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Answer {

    public static void appendOrSkipRow(String filePath, String[] rowCandidate) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {

            List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
            String line;

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] currentRow = line.split(",");
                boolean shouldAdd = true;

                for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(currentRow.length, rowCandidate.length); i++) {
                    if (!currentRow[i].equals(rowCandidate[i])) {
                        shouldAdd = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if (shouldAdd) {
                    lines.add(line);
                } else {
                    // Skip adding the row candidate if it matches any existing row
                }
            }

            // Append the new row candidate if no match found
            boolean newRowAdded = false;
            for (String currentRow : lines) {
                String[] currentRowArray = currentRow.split(",");
                boolean shouldAdd = true;

                for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(currentRowArray.length, rowCandidate.length); i++) {
                    if (!currentRowArray[i].equals(rowCandidate[i])) {
                        shouldAdd = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if (shouldAdd) {
                    newRowAdded = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!newRowAdded) {
                writer.write(String.join(",", rowCandidate));
                writer.newLine();
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does essentially the same thing as your original Python function - it reads through each line in the provided CSV file and checks whether or not it has a match with the `rowCandidate` array based on the first three elements. If there's a match, that line is skipped over. After all lines have been checked, the `rowCandidate` is then written to the file only if it doesn't match any of the previously encountered lines. 

Please note that the above code assumes that the input file (`filePath`) is already sorted by the first three columns. If it is not sorted, you may need to sort it before running this code, otherwise some rows might be missed. Also, this code will overwrite the original file, so make sure to back up your data before running it.
