Sure! Here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Appends a new row to a CSV file if there isn't a row with matching values in the first three columns.
 *
 * @param fileHandler The file handler of the CSV file opened in read-plus mode ('r+').
 * @param reader      The CSV reader object for reading existing rows.
 * @param rowCandidate The list containing the new row to be appended.
 */
public void appendOrSkipRow(FileHandler fileHandler, CSVReader reader, List<String> rowCandidate) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, you typically use interfaces like `FileHandler` and `CSVReader` from libraries such as Apache Commons IO or OpenCSV. Make sure to include the necessary imports at the beginning of your Java file.
