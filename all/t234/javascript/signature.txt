Sure, here is the JavaScript equivalent of the Python function you provided, keeping the same comments and structure:

```javascript
/**
 * Appends a new row to a CSV file if there isn't a row with matching values in the first three columns.
 *
 * @param {FileHandler} fileHandler - The file handler of the CSV file opened in read-plus mode ('r+').
 * @param {CSVReader} reader - The CSV reader object for reading existing rows.
 * @param {Array} rowCandidate - The list containing the new row to be appended.
 */
function appendOrSkipRow(fileHandler, reader, rowCandidate) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments to document functions. The `@param` tags are used to describe each parameter, including their types and descriptions. The `@return` tag is used to describe the return value (if any).
