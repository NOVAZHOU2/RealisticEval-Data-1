Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments and argument types:

```typescript
/**
 * Appends a new row to a CSV file if there isn't a row with matching values in the first three columns.
 *
 * @param fileHandler - File handler of the CSV file opened in read-plus mode ('r+').
 * @param reader - CSV reader object for reading existing rows.
 * @param rowCandidate - Array containing the new row to be appended.
 */
function appendOrSkipRow(fileHandler: fs.ReadStream, reader: csv.CSVParser, rowCandidate: string[]): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that you will need to import the necessary modules (`fs` for file handling and `csv` for CSV parsing) at the top of your TypeScript file.
