Here's the C++ code signature with comments that mirror the JavaScript version:

```cpp
/**
 * Checks if the input string is a significant number.
 * A significant number is defined as a string that:
 * - Is between 5 and 18 characters in length.
 * - Consists only of digits (0-9).
 * - Does not start with '0' if its length is greater than 1.
 *
 * @param input - The input string to check.
 * @returns true if the input is a significant number; otherwise, false.
 */
bool isSignificantNumber(const std::string& input);
```

### Explanation:
- The comment structure is preserved to match the JavaScript version.
- The function signature uses `const std::string&` for the input parameter, similar to the JavaScript version's string type.
- The return type is `bool`, which corresponds to the JavaScript boolean.
