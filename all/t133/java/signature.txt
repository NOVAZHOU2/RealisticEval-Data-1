Here's the Java code signature with comments converted from the JavaScript format:

```java
/**
 * Checks if the input string is a significant number.
 * A significant number is defined as a string that:
 * - Is between 5 and 18 characters in length.
 * - Consists only of digits (0-9).
 * - Does not start with '0' if its length is greater than 1.
 *
 * @param input The input string to check.
 * @return Returns true if the input is a significant number; otherwise, false.
 */
public static boolean isSignificantNumber(String input) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
``` 

This keeps the comments intact while adjusting the syntax for Java.
