Here's the TypeScript version of the function signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Checks if the input string is a significant number.
 * A significant number is defined as a string that:
 * - Is between 5 and 18 characters in length.
 * - Consists only of digits (0-9).
 * - Does not start with '0' if its length is greater than 1.
 *
 * @param {string} input - The input string to check.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the input is a significant number; otherwise, false.
 */
function isSignificantNumber(input: string): boolean {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This keeps the comments and modifies the parameter and return types to match TypeScript's syntax.
