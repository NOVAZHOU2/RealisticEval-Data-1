```java
/**
 * Find the powers of 2 and 3 that multiply to produce the given number.
 *
 * @param num The positive integer greater than zero.
 * @return A tuple (n, m) where n is the power of 2 and m is the power of 3.
 *         Returns null if the number is zero or if the number has prime factors other than 2 and 3.

Please note that Java does not have built-in support for tuples like Python, so you would need to create a custom `Tuple` class or use an existing library such as Apache Commons Lang's `Pair`. Here's an example of how you could implement a simple `Tuple` class:

```java
public class Tuple<X, Y> {
    private X first;
    private Y second;

    public Tuple(X first, Y second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    public X getFirst() {
        return first;
    }

    public Y getSecond() {
        return second;
    }
}
```
