Sure, hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided Python function:

```javascript
function findLargestDivisible(n) {
    /**
     * Find the largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5.
     *
     * @param {number} n - The upper bound of the range.
     * @returns {number | null} - The largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5,
     *                            or null if no such number exists.
     */
    // Start checking from n and go down to half of n
    let start = n;
    let end = Math.floor(n / 2);

    for (let i = start; i > end; i--) {
        if (i % 5 === 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return null;  // Return null if no number divisible by 5 is found
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The function `findLargestDivisible` is defined with a single parameter `n`.
- **Documentation**: A JSDoc comment is added to describe the purpose, parameters, and return type of the function.
- **Range Calculation**:
  - `start`: This remains `n`.
  - `end`: This is calculated as `Math.floor(n / 2)` to ensure it's an integer.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates from `start` down to `end`, decrementing by 1 each time.
- **Divisibility Check**: If `i` is divisible by 5 (`i % 5 === 0`), the function returns `i`.
- **Return Value**: If no number divisible by 5 is found within the range, the function returns `null`.

This JavaScript function maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the original Python function.
