```javascript
/**
 * find the largest integer between a given number n and half of it that is divisible by 10 or 5
 * @param {number} n - The upper bound of the range.
 * @returns {number | null} - The largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5, or
 * null if no such number exists.
 */
function findLargestDivisible(n) {
```

Please note that in JavaScript, there's no built-in equivalent for Python's `Union` type hinting system, so we use union types with the pipe symbol (`|`) to indicate that the function can return either a number or null. Also, JavaScript does not require explicit type annotations for parameters and return values, but adding them makes your code more readable and easier to understand.
