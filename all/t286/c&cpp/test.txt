Sure, I can help you convert your Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2. Below is an example of how you might write the corresponding C++ test case:

First, make sure you have Catch2 installed in your project. If not, you can add it via a package manager or download it manually.

Here's a simple example of what the C++ test case might look like:

```cpp
#include "catch.hpp"
#include <iostream>

// Assuming the function is defined somewhere in your project
extern int find_largest_divisible(int n);

TEST_CASE("Find Largest Divisible", "[find_largest_divisible]") {
    SECTION("n is less than 5") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(4) == nullptr);
    }

    SECTION("n is exactly 5") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(5) == 5);
    }

    SECTION("n is between 5 and 10") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(7) == 5);
    }

    SECTION("n is between 10 and 15") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(13) == 10);
    }

    SECTION("n is exactly 10") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(10) == 10);
    }

    SECTION("n is between 15 and 20") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(18) == 15);
    }

    SECTION("n is between 20 and 25") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(23) == 20);
    }

    SECTION("n is exactly 25") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(25) == 25);
    }

    SECTION("n is greater than 25") {
        REQUIRE(find_largest_divisible(30) == 25);
    }
}
```

In this example, `find_largest_divisible` is assumed to be a function that returns an `int`. If your function returns `nullptr`, you should adjust the assertions accordingly.

To compile and run the tests with Catch2, you would typically include the Catch2 header and link against the Catch2 library. Hereâ€™s an example using g++:

```sh
g++ -std=c++11 -I/path/to/catch2/include -o test_find_largest_divisible test_find_largest_divisible.cpp
./test_find_largest_divisible
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/catch2/include` with the actual path where Catch2 is installed on your system.
