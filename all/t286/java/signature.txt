Sure, here's how you can translate the Python code signature into Java code signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Find the largest integer between a given number n and half of it that is divisible by 10 or 5.
 *
 * @param n The upper bound of the range.
 * @return The largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5, or
 *         null if no such number exists.
 */
public Integer findLargestDivisible(int n) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `Union` type hint**, so we use `Integer` instead of `Union[int, None]`. In Java, `null` is used to represent the absence of a value where an object reference is expected.
  
- **Java uses docstrings** (`/** ... */`) for documentation purposes, similar to Python's triple-quote strings (`"""..."""`).

- **Java method signatures include the return type (`Integer`)** followed by the method name (`findLargestDivisible`), parameters (`int n`), and the method body enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

This should give you a clear and understandable Java version of your Python function signature with preserved comments.
