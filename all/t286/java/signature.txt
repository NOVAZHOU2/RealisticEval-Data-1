Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, including the conversion of the function signature, comments, and docstrings into the appropriate Java style:

```java
import java.util.Optional;

package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Finds the largest integer between a given number n and half of it that is divisible by 10 or 5.
     *
     * @param n The upper bound of the range.
     * @return The largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5, or
     *         Optional.empty() if no such number exists.
     */
    public static Optional<Integer> findLargestDivisible(int n) {
        // Start checking from n and go down to half of n
        int start = n;
        int end = n / 2;

        for (int i = start; i > end; i--) {
            if (i % 5 == 0 || i % 10 == 0) {
                return Optional.of(i);
            }
        }

        return Optional.empty();  // Return Optional.empty() if no number divisible by 5 or 10 is found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int n = 20;
        Optional<Integer> result = findLargestDivisible(n);
        System.out.println("The largest integer divisible by 5 or 10 between " + n + " and half of " + n + " is: " + result.orElse(null));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
2. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined within the package.
3. **Import Statement**: The `Optional` class from the `java.util` package is imported to handle the possibility of returning `null`.
4. **Method Signature**: The method `findLargestDivisible` is declared as `public static Optional<Integer> findLargestDivisible(int n)` to match the functionality of the Python function.
5. **Javadoc Comments**: The Python docstring is converted into a Javadoc comment block, providing detailed documentation for the method.
6. **Logic**: The logic inside the method remains the same, iterating from `n` down to `n / 2` and checking for divisibility by 5 or 10.
7. **Return Type**: The method returns an `Optional<Integer>` object, which can be `Optional.empty()` if no number divisible by 5 or 10 is found.
8. **Main Method**: A `main` method is included for testing purposes, demonstrating how to call the `findLargestDivisible` method and print the result using `orElse(null)` to handle the `Optional.empty()` case.

This Java code preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to Java's syntax and conventions.
