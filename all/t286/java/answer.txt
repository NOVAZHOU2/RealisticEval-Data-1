Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. I have ensured that the functionality remains consistent while adhering to Java’s syntax and best practices:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Find the largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5.
     *
     * @param n The upper bound of the range.
     * @return The largest integer between n and half of n that is divisible by 5,
     *         or null if no such number exists.
     */
    public static Integer findLargestDivisible(int n) {
        // Start checking from n and go down to half of n
        int start = n;
        int end = n / 2;

        for (int i = start; i > end; i--) {
            if (i % 5 == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return null;  // Return null if no number divisible by 5 is found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        System.out.println(findLargestDivisible(25));  // Expected output: 25
        System.out.println(findLargestDivisible(10));  // Expected output: 10
        System.out.println(findLargestDivisible(7));   // Expected output: null
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
2. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined within this package.
3. **Method Signature**: The method `findLargestDivisible` is declared as `public static Integer findLargestDivisible(int n)`. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns an `Integer` object, which can be `null` if no suitable number is found.
4. **Logic**: The logic within the method remains the same, iterating from `n` down to `n / 2` and checking divisibility by 5.
5. **Main Method**: A `main` method is included for testing purposes, demonstrating how to call the `findLargestDivisible` method and print the results.

This Java code preserves the functionality of the original Python code while adhering to Java’s syntax and conventions.
