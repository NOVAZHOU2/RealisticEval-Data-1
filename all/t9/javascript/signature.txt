Sure, here's the JavaScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether point C is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 * @param {number[]} A - Point A coordinates [x, y].
 * @param {number[]} B - Point B coordinates [x, y].
 * @param {number[]} C - Point C coordinates [x, y].
 * @returns {boolean} - True if point C is on the line formed by points A and B, false otherwise.
 */
function isPointOnLine(A, B, C) {
    // Your implementation goes here...
}
```

This JavaScript function `isPointOnLine` takes three parameters: `A`, `B`, and `C`, each represented as an array of two numbers `[x, y]`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether point `C` lies on the line segment formed by points `A` and `B`.
