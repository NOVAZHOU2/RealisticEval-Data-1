Certainly! I'll convert the given Python function signature and comments into equivalent JavaScript syntax, including JSDoc comments for proper documentation.

Hereâ€™s the converted JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether a point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 * 
 * @param {Array<number>} A - Point A [x, y]
 * @param {Array<number>} B - Point B [x, y]
 * @param {Array<number>} C - Point C [x, y]
 * @returns {boolean} - True if point C is on the line formed by points A and B, false otherwise.
 */
function isPointOnLine(A, B, C) {
    const [x_a, y_a] = A;
    const [x_b, y_b] = B;
    const [x_c, y_c] = C;

    // Handle the vertical line case where the x-coordinates of points A and B are the same
    if (x_a === x_b) {
        return x_c === x_a;  // C must also have the same x-coordinate
    }

    // Calculate slopes using the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    // Check if slopes of AC and BC are equal
    return (y_c - y_a) * (x_b - x_a) === (y_b - y_a) * (x_c - x_a);
}
```

### Explanation:
- The JSDoc comment at the beginning provides a clear description of the function and its parameters.
- The parameter types are specified using `@param` tags, and the return type is specified using the `@returns` tag.
- The function name `isPointOnLine` follows camelCase convention, which is common in JavaScript.
- The logic inside the function remains the same, ensuring that the functionality is preserved.

This conversion ensures that the JavaScript code is well-documented and maintains the same functionality as the original Python code.
