Hereâ€™s the converted Python code signature to JavaScript, keeping the comments in a JavaScript style:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether a point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} A - Point A (x, y)
 * @param {number[]} B - Point B (x, y)
 * @param {number[]} C - Point C (x, y)
 * @returns {boolean} - Is C in line of A and B
 */
function isPointOnLine(A, B, C) {
    // Your code logic here
}
```

Feel free to add the logic inside the function!
