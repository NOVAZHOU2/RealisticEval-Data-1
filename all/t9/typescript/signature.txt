Sure, here's the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Check whether point C is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} A - The coordinates of point A [x, y].
 * @param {number[]} B - The coordinates of point B [x, y].
 * @param {number[]} C - The coordinates of point C [x, y].
 * @returns {boolean} - Whether point C is on the line formed by points A and B.
 */
function isPointOnLine(A: number[], B: number[], C: number[]): boolean {
```

This TypeScript function `isPointOnLine` takes three parameters, each representing the coordinates of a point `[x, y]`, and returns a boolean indicating whether point C lies on the line segment formed by points A and B.
