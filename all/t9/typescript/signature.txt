Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code signature with comments converted to TypeScript style documentation:

```typescript
function isPointOnLine(A: number[], B: number[], C: number[]): boolean {
    /**
     * Check whether a point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
     * 
     * @param A - point A (x, y)
     * @param B - point B (x, y)
     * @param C - point C (x, y)
     * 
     * @returns true if C is on the line formed by A and B, otherwise false.
     */
}
```
