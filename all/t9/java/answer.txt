Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function. The code will be in the package `org.real.temp` and inside a class named `Answer`.

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.List;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Check whether a point C is on a line formed by two points A and B.
     * 
     * @param A point A coordinates (x, y)
     * @param B point B coordinates (x, y)
     * @param C point C coordinates (x, y)
     * @return true if point C is on the line formed by points A and B, false otherwise
     */
    public static boolean isPointOnLine(List<Integer> A, List<Integer> B, List<Integer> C) {
        // Using the formula to check if the area of the triangle formed by points A, B, and C is zero
        // Area = 0 means that points A, B, and C are collinear
        
        int area = A.get(0) * (B.get(1) - C.get(1)) + 
                   B.get(0) * (C.get(1) - A.get(1)) + 
                   C.get(0) * (A.get(1) - B.get(1));
        
        return area == 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `isPointOnLine` method takes three points A, B, and C as lists of integers (representing coordinates).
- It calculates the area of the triangle formed by these points. If the area is zero, then the points are collinear, meaning point C is on the line formed by A and B.
- The return type is `boolean`, similar to the Python function.
