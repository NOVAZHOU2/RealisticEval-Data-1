Here's the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    /**
     * Check whether A point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
     *
     * @param A The coordinates of point A as a list of integers [x, y].
     * @param B The coordinates of point B as a list of integers [x, y].
     * @param C The coordinates of point C as a list of integers [x, y].
     * @return true if point C lies on the line formed by points A and B; false otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean isPointOnLine(List<Integer> A, List<Integer> B, List<Integer> C) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

Please note that in Java, you need to implement the logic inside the `isPointOnLine` method according to your requirements. The provided code only includes the method signature and documentation comment.
