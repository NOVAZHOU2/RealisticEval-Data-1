Hereâ€™s the converted Java code signature with comments in the appropriate style:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Check whether a point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 *
 * @param A point A xy
 * @param B point B xy
 * @param C point C xy
 * @return true if C is on the line of A and B, false otherwise
 */
public boolean isPointOnLine(List<Integer> A, List<Integer> B, List<Integer> C) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```
