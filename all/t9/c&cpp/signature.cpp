/**
 * @brief Checks if a point is on the line formed by two other points.
 *
 * This function determines whether point C lies on the line segment 
 * connecting points A and B. The check is performed using the concept of 
 * collinearity based on the cross product.
 *
 * @param A A vector representing the coordinates of point A [x, y].
 * @param B A vector representing the coordinates of point B [x, y].
 * @param C A vector representing the coordinates of point C [x, y].
 * @return True if point C lies on the line formed by points A and B, 
 *         False otherwise.
