Sure, here's the equivalent C++ code for your Python function:

```cpp
#include <vector>

bool isPointOnLine(const std::vector<int>& A, const std::vector<int>& B, const std::vector<int>& C) {
    // Check if the area of triangle ABC is zero
    int area = 0.5 * abs(A[0] * (B[1] - C[1]) + B[0] * (C[1] - A[1]) + C[0] * (A[1] - B[1]));
    
    return area == 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `isPointOnLine` takes three vectors of integers representing the coordinates of points A, B, and C.
- It calculates the area of the triangle formed by these three points using the determinant method.
- If the area is zero, it means that the points are collinear, i.e., point C lies on the line segment AB.

This C++ code should work similarly to your original Python function.
