Hereâ€™s the converted C++ code signature with comments in the appropriate style:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Check whether a point is on a line formed by two points, such as point C is on a line formed by points A and B.
 * 
 * @param A A vector representing point A (xy).
 * @param B A vector representing point B (xy).
 * @param C A vector representing point C (xy).
 * 
 * @return true if C is on the line formed by A and B, otherwise false.
 */
bool is_point_on_line(const std::vector<int>& A, const std::vector<int>& B, const std::vector<int>& C);
```
