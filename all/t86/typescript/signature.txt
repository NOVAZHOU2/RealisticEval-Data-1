Here is the equivalent TypeScript function with the same signature and comments:

```typescript
function bresenhamLine(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number): Array<[number, number]> {
    /**
     * Generates integer coordinates on the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using Bresenham's line algorithm.
     *
     * Bresenham's algorithm calculates the points of an approximately straight line between two given points on a grid.
     * It is particularly well-suited for computer graphics where an efficient, integer-based algorithm is needed to
     * determine which points should be rasterized to represent the line.
     *
     * @param x1 - The x-coordinate of the starting point of the line.
     * @param y1 - The y-coordinate of the starting point of the line.
     * @param x2 - The x-coordinate of the ending point of the line.
     * @param y2 - The y-coordinate of the ending point of the line.
     * @returns An array where each element is a tuple containing the x and y coordinates of a point on the line.
     */
```

Note that in TypeScript, we use `Array<[number, number]>` instead of `List[tuple]`, and the `@param` tag is used for parameter documentation.
