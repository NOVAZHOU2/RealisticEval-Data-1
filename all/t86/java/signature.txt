/**
 * Generates integer coordinates on the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using Bresenham's line algorithm.
 *
 * Bresenham's algorithm calculates the points of an approximately straight line between two given points on a grid.
 * It is particularly well-suited for computer graphics where an efficient, integer-based algorithm is needed to
 * determine which points should be rasterized to represent the line.
 *
 * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the starting point of the line.
 * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the starting point of the line.
 * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the ending point of the line.
 * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the ending point of the line.
 * @return A list where each element is an array containing the x and y coordinates of a point on the line.

Please note that the actual implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm is not provided in this Java code snippet. You would need to add the logic inside the `bresenhamLine` method to complete it.
