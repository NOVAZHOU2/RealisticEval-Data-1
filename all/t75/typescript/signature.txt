Sure! Below is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Renames PNG files in a specified directory by appending a sequence number to each file.
 * The files are sorted alphabetically, and each base name is assigned sequential numbers.
 * For example:
 *     If the directory contains three PNG files named "image1.png", "image2.png", "image3.png",
 *     after renaming, they will be named "image1001.png", "image2001.png", "image3001.png".
 *
 * @param {string} directory - The path to the directory containing PNG files to be renamed.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function renameFiles(directory: string): void {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This TypeScript function signature matches the original Python function's parameters and return type, along with the provided docstring.
