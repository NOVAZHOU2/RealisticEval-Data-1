Sure, here is the C++ code signature for the given Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

/**
 * Renames PNG files in a specified directory by appending a sequence number to each file.
 * The files are sorted alphabetically, and each base name is assigned sequential numbers.
 * For example:
 *     If the directory contains three PNG files named "image1.png", "image2.png", "image3.png",
 *     after renaming, the files will be named "image1001.png", "image2001.png", "image3001.png".
 *
 * @param directory The path to the directory containing PNG files to be renamed.
 */
void renameFiles(const std::string& directory);
```

This C++ code uses the `<filesystem>` library to handle file operations and includes necessary headers for string manipulation and algorithmic operations. The function `renameFiles` takes a single parameter of type `const std::string&`, which represents the path to the directory containing the PNG files to be renamed.
