Here's the JavaScript code signature for your Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Renames PNG files in a specified directory by appending a sequence number to each file.
 * The files are sorted alphabetically, and each base name is assigned sequential numbers.
 * For example:
 *     If the directory contains three PNG files named "image1.png", "image2.png", "image3.png",
 *     after renaming, they will be "image1001.png", "image2001.png", "image3001.png".
 *
 * @param {string} directory - The path to the directory containing PNG files to be renamed.
 * @returns {void}
 */
```

This JavaScript version of the comment follows JSDoc format, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects for documentation purposes. It provides a clear description of what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.
