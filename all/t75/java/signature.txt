Here's the equivalent Java code signature for the given Python function:

```java
/**
 * Renames PNG files in a specified directory by appending a sequence number to each file.
 * The files are sorted alphabetically, and each base name is assigned sequential numbers.
 * For example:
 *     If a directory contains three PNG files named "image1.png", "image2.png", and "image3.png",
 *     after renaming, the files will be named "image1001.png", "image2001.png", and "image3001.png".
 *
 * @param directory The path to the directory containing PNG files to be renamed.
 */
public static void renameFiles(String directory) {
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as the original Python function. It specifies that the method `renameFiles` takes a single parameter of type `String` representing the directory path and does not return any value (`void`).
