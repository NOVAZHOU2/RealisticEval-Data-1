Here is how you can change the Python function signature to Java:

```java
/**
 * Converts a snake_case string to CamelCase.
 *
 * @param snakeStr The snake_case string to convert.
 * @return The converted CamelCase string.
 */
public static String snakeToCamel(String snakeStr) {
```

Note that in Java, we use `static` if the method belongs to the class itself and not to any specific instance of the class. Also, Java uses camelCase for variable and method names, but it uses PascalCase (first letter capitalized) for class names.
