Hereâ€™s the conversion of the provided C++ code signature to a Python code signature, along with the comments converted to Python-style comments:
python
class MaxHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []  # List to store heap elements

    # Helper function to maintain the max heap property
    def heapify_up(self, index):
        pass

    # Helper function to maintain the max heap property after deletion
    def heapify_down(self, index):
        pass

    # Insert a new element into the heap
    def insert(self, value):
        pass

    # Remove and return the maximum element from the heap
    def extract_max(self):
        pass

    # Get the maximum element without removing it
    def get_max(self):
        pass

    # Check if the heap is empty
    def is_empty(self):
        pass

    # Get the size of the heap
    def size(self):
        pass
Changes Made:
Class Declaration: The class declaration remains the same, as both languages use the class keyword.
Constructor: The C++ constructor is replaced with __init__ in Python.
Member Variables: The heap vector in C++ is replaced with a Python list.
Method Names: C++ method names have been converted to Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Comments: C++ comments (//) have been changed to Python comments (#).
