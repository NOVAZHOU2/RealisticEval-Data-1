class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def find_primes(lower_bound, upper_bound):
        prime_numbers = []
        for number in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
            if Answer.is_prime(number):
                prime_numbers.append(number)
        return prime_numbers

    @staticmethod
    def compute_sum_of_primes(primes):
        total = sum(primes)
        return total

    @staticmethod
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num == 2 or num == 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    lower_bound = 10
    upper_bound = 50
    primes = Answer.find_primes(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    print(f"Prime numbers between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}: {primes}")
    print(f"Sum of prime numbers: {Answer.compute_sum_of_primes(primes)}")
Explanation of the Code
Class Definition: The Answer class encapsulates all methods as static methods, similar to how it's done in the Java class.
Finding Primes: The find_primes method iterates over the range from lower_bound to upper_bound (inclusive) and collects prime numbers.
Computing Sum of Primes: The compute_sum_of_primes method calculates the sum of the list of prime numbers using Python's built-in sum function.
Checking for Primality: The is_prime method checks if a number is prime, using similar logic as the Java version, including optimizations for small numbers and only testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
Example Usage: At the bottom, there is a simple example of how to use the class to find prime numbers within a specified range and calculate their sum.
