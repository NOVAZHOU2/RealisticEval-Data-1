Certainly! Below is the conversion of the provided Java JUnit test cases into Python's unittest framework. The structure remains similar, and the logic of the tests is preserved.
Python Test Case Using unittest
python
import unittest
from typing import List

# Assuming the Answer class is defined elsewhere
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def find_primes(lower_bound: int, upper_bound: int) -> List[int]:
        # Placeholder implementation
        prime_numbers = []
        for number in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
            if Answer.is_prime(number):
                prime_numbers.append(number)
        return prime_numbers

    @staticmethod
    def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num == 2 or num == 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True


class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_find_primes_in_range(self):
        expected = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
        self.assertEqual(Answer.find_primes(1, 12), expected, "Check primes between 1 and 12")

    def test_find_primes_single_prime(self):
        expected = [29]
        self.assertEqual(Answer.find_primes(29, 29), expected, "Check single prime number")

    def test_find_primes_in_big_range(self):
        expected = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
        self.assertEqual(Answer.find_primes(1, 100), expected, "Check primes between 1 and 100")

    def test_find_primes_no_primes(self):
        expected = []
        self.assertEqual(Answer.find_primes(0, 1), expected, "Check range with no primes")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of Changes:
Imports:
Imported unittest to use the testing framework.
Used List from typing to specify list types.
Class Definition:
The Java Tester class is translated into TestAnswer class in Python.
Test Method Names:
The test method names were kept similar for clarity, following the convention of starting with test_.
Assertions:
Used self.assertEqual() to compare the expected results with the actual output from Answer.find_primes(), similar to the JUnit assertEquals.
Expected Values:
The expected results are represented as lists in Python, and the assertion messages are also preserved.
Main Block:
Added the standard if __name__ == '__main__': block to allow the script to run the tests when executed directly.
Running the Tests:
You can run this code in any Python environment that supports the unittest framework, typically via the command line using:
bash
python -m unittest <filename>.py
Replace <filename>.py with the name of your Python file containing the test code.
