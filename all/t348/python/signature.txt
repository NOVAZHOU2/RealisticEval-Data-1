To convert the Java function signature to Python, we will make a few adjustments based on Python's syntax and conventions. Here’s the Java function signature you provided and the corresponding Python version:
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Find all primes in a given range and calculate the sum of those primes
 *
 * @param lowerBound The starting point of the range to check for prime numbers. Must be a non-negative integer.
 * @param upperBound The endpoint of the range to check for prime numbers. Must be equal to or greater than lowerBound.
 * @return A List<Integer> containing all the prime numbers found in the specified range. The list will be empty if no primes are found.
 */
public static List<Integer> findPrimes(int lowerBound, int upperBound) {}
Python Function Signature
In Python, we typically use List from the typing module to denote a list type, and we don’t need to declare types in the same way as Java. However, we can still provide type hints. Here’s how it would look:
python
from typing import List

def find_primes(lower_bound: int, upper_bound: int) -> List[int]:
    pass
Explanation of Changes:
Method Name: Changed from findPrimes (camelCase) to find_primes (snake_case), which is the convention in Python.
Parameters: Changed parameter names to snake_case (lowerBound to lower_bound and upperBound to upper_bound).
Return Type: Used -> List[int] to indicate that the function returns a list of integers.
Pass Statement: Added pass to indicate that the function does not contain any implementation yet.
This Python function signature is now ready to be implemented with the logic to find prime numbers within the specified range. If you need help with the implementation as well, let me know!
