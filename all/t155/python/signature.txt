To convert the TypeScript code signature you provided to a Python code signature while keeping the comments, you can follow the conventions of Python typing. Below is the equivalent Python code signature:
python
from datetime import datetime

def get_timestamp(created_at: datetime) -> str:
    """Computes the difference between the specified date and the current time, returning it in a human-readable way.
    
    Args:
        created_at (datetime): The date to calculate the time difference from.
        
    Returns:
        str: A string indicating the time elapsed, e.g., "3 days ago", "5 hours ago".
    """
    pass  # Replace this with the implementation
Breakdown of Changes:
Function Declaration: The export const is not applicable in Python; instead, you simply define the function using def.
Parameter and Return Types: In Python, you use -> for the return type, and : after the parameter to indicate its type.
Datetime Import: In Python, you'll need to import datetime from the datetime module to work with date and time objects.
Docstring Format: The comments have been converted into a Python docstring format for better readability and structure, following the conventions used in Python documentation.
This code signature is ready for implementation in Python.
