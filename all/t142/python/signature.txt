Here’s the equivalent Python code signature with the comments retained, as per your request:
TypeScript Code Signature
typescript
/** 
 * Converts a camelCase string to a format with the first letter capitalized and spaces between words.
 * For example:
 *      input: "thisIsTest"
 *      output: "This is test"
 *
 * @param input The camelCase string to be converted.
 * @returns The converted string with spaces and initial capitalization.

Python Code Signature
python
def camel_case_to_capitalized_with_spaces(input: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts a camelCase string to a format with the first letter capitalized and spaces between words.
    For example:
         input: "thisIsTest"
         output: "This is test"

    :param input: The camelCase string to be converted.
    :returns: The converted string with spaces and initial capitalization.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
TypeScript uses camelCaseToCapitalizedWithSpaces, while Python convention prefers snake_case for function names, so it’s changed to camel_case_to_capitalized_with_spaces.
Docstring:
The docstring in Python is similar to TypeScript comments, but it uses triple quotes (""") and follows Python’s documentation style.
The @param and @returns annotations in TypeScript are replaced with :param and :returns in the Python docstring.
Type Hints:
The TypeScript types string are converted to Python's type hint str.
This Python signature will now be functionally equivalent to the TypeScript signature.
