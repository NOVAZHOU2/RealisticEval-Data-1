Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code signature with comments, following the structure of your TypeScript function:

```java
/**
 * Converts a camelCase string to a format with the first letter capitalized and spaces between words.
 * For example:
 *      input: "thisIsTest"
 *      output: "This is test"
 *
 * @param input The camelCase string to be converted.
 * @return The converted string with spaces and initial capitalization.
 */
public static String camelCaseToCapitalizedWithSpaces(String input) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

You can insert the existing implementation inside the method body. Let me know if you need any more help!
