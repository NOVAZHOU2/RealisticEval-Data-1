Sure! Here's the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Empties all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.
 *
 * @param directoryPath The path to the directory whose contents are to be emptied.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the specified path does not exist or is not a directory.
 */
public void emptyDirectory(String directoryPath) {
```

This Java method `emptyDirectory` takes a single parameter `directoryPath` of type `String`. It also includes a Javadoc comment that describes the purpose of the method, its parameters, and the exception it throws.
