Certainly! Below is the C++ code signature equivalent to the provided Python function, including the necessary comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>

/**
 * Empties all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.
 *
 * @param directoryPath The path to the directory whose contents are to be emptied.
 * @return void or std::invalid_argument: If the specified path does not exist or is not a directory.
 */
void emptyDirectory(const std::string& directoryPath);
```

### Explanation:
- **Include Directives**: The `<string>` header is included for handling string operations, and `<filesystem>` is included for file system operations.
- **Function Signature**:
  - `void emptyDirectory(const std::string& directoryPath)`: This function takes a constant reference to a string representing the path of the directory to be emptied and returns nothing (`void`).
- **Docstring**: The docstring is translated into a comment above the function declaration using Doxygen-style comments, which is commonly used in C++ projects for generating documentation.
