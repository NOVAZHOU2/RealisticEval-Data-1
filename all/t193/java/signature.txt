Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method converted from the provided C++ code, including proper comments in Javadoc format:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Invert the flag bits of an unsigned integer to a hexadecimal string. The number of bits is not complete by 0.
     *
     * @param value The unsigned integer whose bits are to be inverted.
     * @return A String containing the hexadecimal representation of the inverted bits.
     */
    public String convFlags(int value) {
        // Method implementation goes here
        return null; // Placeholder for actual implementation
    }
}
```

In this version, the C++ `unsigned int` type is represented as `int` in Java, since Java does not have an unsigned integer type. The function is structured according to Java conventions, with a placeholder for the implementation. Let me know if you need any further details or adjustments!
