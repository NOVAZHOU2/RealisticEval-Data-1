Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature based on your C++ code:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Invert the flag bits of an unsigned integer to a hexadecimal string. The number of bits is not complete by 0.
 *
 * @param value The unsigned integer whose bits are to be inverted.
 * @return A string containing the hexadecimal representation of the inverted bits.
 */
function convFlags(value: number): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Function Signature**: Converted `std::string` to `string` and `unsigned int` to `number`.
2. **Comments**: Translated C++ comments to TypeScript-style comments, maintaining their formatting and content.
3. **Body Placeholder**: Included a placeholder comment for the function implementation.
