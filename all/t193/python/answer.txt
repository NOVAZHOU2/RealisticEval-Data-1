Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function. The Python version includes the necessary functionality to invert the first five bits of an unsigned integer and return the result as a hexadecimal string.
Converted Python Code
python
def conv_flags(value: int) -> str:
    """
    Invert the flag bits of an unsigned integer to a hexadecimal string.
    
    :param value: The unsigned integer whose bits are to be inverted.
    :return: A string containing the hexadecimal representation of the inverted bits.
    """
    # Create a mask for the first five bits (0x1F = 00011111)
    mask = 0x1F
    
    # Invert the first five bits using XOR
    inverted_value = value ^ mask
    
    # Convert the result to a hexadecimal string
    hex_string = hex(inverted_value)[2:]  # [2:] to remove '0x' prefix
    
    return hex_string

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = conv_flags(29)  # Example input
    print(f"Hexadecimal representation of inverted bits: {result}")
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition:
The function conv_flags takes an integer value as input.
Mask Creation:
A mask for the first five bits is created using 0x1F, which is equivalent to the binary 00011111.
Bitwise Operation:
The first five bits of value are inverted using the XOR operator (^).
Hexadecimal Conversion:
The result is converted to a hexadecimal string using Python's built-in hex() function. The [2:] slice is used to remove the '0x' prefix that hex() adds.
Return Value:
The function returns the hexadecimal representation as a string.
Example Usage:
A simple example is included to demonstrate how to call the function and print the result.
Note:
In Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, so you don't have to explicitly declare them as unsigned integers as you would in C++. However, if you want to enforce that only non-negative integers are used, you could add a check at the beginning of the function.
