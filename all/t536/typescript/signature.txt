Sure! Here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted date string.
 */
function getDate(): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, you need to specify the return type of the function using `: string`. If you have any parameters, you would also include their types in the parentheses. Since there are no parameters in this function, we only specify the return type.
