Certainly! Here is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted date string.
 */
function getDate(): string {
}
```

In TypeScript, you need to specify the return type of the function using `: string`. This helps in ensuring that the function always returns a string and provides better type checking during development.
