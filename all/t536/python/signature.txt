To convert the JavaScript function signature and documentation comment into Python code signature and docstring, you can follow this structure:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @returns {string} The formatted date string.
 */
function getDate() {}
Python Code Signature
python
def get_date() -> str:
    """
    Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted date string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Breakdown of the Conversion:
Function Name:
In JavaScript, the function is named getDate(), while in Python, it is conventionally named get_date() to follow the PEP 8 naming conventions (snake_case).
Return Type Annotation:
The return type is specified using -> str in Python, indicating that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
The documentation comment from JavaScript is converted into a docstring in Python.
It uses triple quotes (""") and provides the same description and return type information.
Function Implementation:
The pass statement is a placeholder for the function implementation, indicating that the function is defined but not yet implemented.
Full Example:
Hereâ€™s the full example including the function signature and docstring:
python
def get_date() -> str:
    """
    Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted date string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
This Python signature is now correctly structured and conveys the same intent as the original JavaScript code.
