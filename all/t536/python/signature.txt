Certainly! Below is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same signature and comments:

```python
"""
Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.

@returns str: The formatted date string.
"""
def get_date():
    pass
```

This Python function `get_date` follows the same structure and comments as your original JavaScript function. The `pass` statement is used here because the actual implementation of the function has not been provided yet.
