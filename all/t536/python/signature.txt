Certainly! Below is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same signature and comments:

```python
import datetime

/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @returns {str} The formatted date string.
 */
def get_date():
    pass
```

This Python function `get_date` will return the current date formatted as "Month Day, Year". Note that in Python, you typically use docstrings instead of JSDoc style comments. Here's how you might implement the actual functionality within the function:

```python
import datetime

/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @returns {str} The formatted date string.
 */
def get_date():
    today = datetime.datetime.now()
    return today.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
```

In this implementation:
- `datetime.datetime.now()` gets the current date and time.
- `strftime("%B %d, %Y")` formats the date as "Month Day, Year".
