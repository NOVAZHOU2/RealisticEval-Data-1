Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @return std::string The formatted date string.
 */
std::string getDate();
```

This C++ function signature follows the same pattern as your JavaScript function, including the docstring (comment) that describes what the function does and what it returns.
