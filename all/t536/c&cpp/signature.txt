Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @return std::string The formatted date string.
 */
std::string getDate();
```

This function declaration in C++ follows the same structure and includes the necessary comment block for documentation purposes.
