Here's the Java code signature with comments maintained:

```java
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @return The formatted date string.
 */
public static String getDate() {
}
``` 

This structure keeps the same purpose as your JavaScript signature while adapting it to Java conventions.
