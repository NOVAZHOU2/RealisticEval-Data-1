Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code with the same signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Gets the current date formatted as 'Month Day, Year'.
 *
 * @return String The formatted date string.
 */
public String getDate() {
}
```

In Java, method signatures include the return type, method name, and parameters (if any). The `@return` tag in the Javadoc comment specifies the return type of the method.
