To convert the provided TypeScript code signature to a Python code signature while retaining the comments, hereâ€™s how it can be structured:
python
def parse_markdown_titles(markdown: str) -> dict[str, list[str]]:
    """
    Parses markdown text to extract titles of different levels.

    This function takes a string of markdown content as input and returns an
    object containing arrays of titles categorized by their level:
    level 1 (H1), level 2 (H2), and level 3 (H3).

    Args:
        markdown (str): A string containing markdown formatted text.

    Returns:
        dict[str, list[str]]: A dictionary with three properties: level1, level2, and level3,
                               each holding a list of corresponding titles found in the markdown.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of the Changes:
Function Definition: In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword.
Parameter and Return Types: The parameter type is specified with : str for the markdown argument. The return type is specified as -> dict[str, list[str]], indicating that the function returns a dictionary with string keys and list values.
Docstring: The comments are converted into a Python docstring format, which starts and ends with triple quotes ("""). The parameters and return values are documented using Args: and Returns:, respectively.
Placeholder for Implementation: In the last line, pass is used as a placeholder to indicate that the function implementation will go here.
