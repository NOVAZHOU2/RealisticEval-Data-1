def parse_markdown_titles(markdown: str) -> dict:

    Parses markdown text to extract titles of different levels.

    This function takes a string of markdown content as input and returns an
    object containing arrays of titles categorized by their level:
    level 1 (H1), level 2 (H2), and level 3 (H3).

    Args:
        markdown (str): A string containing markdown formatted text.

    Returns:
        dict: An object with three properties: level1, level2, and level3,
              each holding an array of corresponding titles found in the markdown.

Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition:
The function is defined with the name parse_markdown_titles, taking one parameter markdown of type str and returning a dict.
Docstring:
The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value.
Initialization:
A dictionary named result is initialized to store lists for titles of each level: level1, level2, and level3.
Line Processing:
The input markdown string is split into lines using split('\n'), creating a list of lines.
Each line is processed in a loop:
Leading and trailing whitespace is removed using strip().
The function checks if a line starts with # , ## , or ### to determine its title level.
The title is extracted and appended to the corresponding list in the result dictionary.
Return Statement:
The function returns the result dictionary containing the categorized titles.
This Python implementation effectively mirrors the functionality of the original TypeScript code while adhering to Python syntax and best practices.
