Hereâ€™s the Java method signature with the comments retained:

```java
/**

 * from the second list based on a unique identifier. If an ID exists in both
 * lists, the item from the second list will replace the one in the first.
 *
 * @param arr1 - The first list of objects to merge.
 * @param arr2 - The second list of objects to merge, which may update
 *               items in the first list.
 * @param getId - A function that takes an object and returns its unique ID
 *                as a string, used to identify items for merging.
 * @returns A list of merged objects, including all unique items from both
 *          input lists, with updates applied from the second list.
