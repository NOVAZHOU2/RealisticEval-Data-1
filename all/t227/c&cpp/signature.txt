Here is the C++ code signature for your Python function:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Count the number of unique colors in an image.
 *
 * @param image_path The path to the image file.
 * @return The number of unique colors in the image.
 */
int countUniqueColors(const std::string& image_path);
```

Please note that actual implementation of `countUniqueColors` function will depend on how you want to handle and process the image data in C++.
