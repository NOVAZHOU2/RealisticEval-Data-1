Sure, I can help you convert the Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2. Below is an example of how you might write a test for the `count_unique_colors` function in C++ using Catch2.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed and set up in your project. You can download it from [Catch2's GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Here's an example of how you might write the test:

```cpp
#include "catch.hpp"
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

// Assuming the function count_unique_colors is defined somewhere in your codebase
int count_unique_colors(const std::string& image_path);

TEST_CASE("Count unique colors in an image", "[image]") {
    // Test with a valid image path
    SECTION("Valid image path") {
        std::string valid_image_path = "path/to/valid/image.jpg";
        int result = count_unique_colors(valid_image_path);
        REQUIRE(result >= 0); // Ensure the result is non-negative
    }

    // Test with an invalid image path
    SECTION("Invalid image path") {
        std::string invalid_image_path = "path/to/nonexistent/image.jpg";
        int result = count_unique_colors(invalid_image_path);
        REQUIRE(result == -1); // Assuming -1 indicates an error or invalid input
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2**: The `#include "catch.hpp"` directive includes the Catch2 header file.
2. **Function Prototype**: The `count_unique_colors` function prototype is included. Make sure this function is available in your project.
3. **Test Case Definition**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a test case named "Count unique colors in an image".
4. **Sections**: Inside the test case, `SECTION` macros define individual test scenarios.
5. **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to assert that certain conditions must be true. For example, `REQUIRE(result >= 0)` ensures that the result is non-negative, which is a reasonable assumption for the number of unique colors.

Make sure to adjust the expected values (`-1` in this example) based on how your function handles errors or invalid inputs.

This should give you a good starting point for converting your Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2.
