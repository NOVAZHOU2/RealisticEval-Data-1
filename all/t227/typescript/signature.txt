Sure! Here is the TypeScript code signature for the given Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Count the number of unique colors in an image.
 *
 * @param image_path - Path to the image file.
 * @returns The number of unique colors in the image.
 */
function countUniqueColors(imagePath: string): Promise<number>;
```

In TypeScript, we use `Promise<number>` because image processing operations can be asynchronous and may involve I/O operations like reading files. If you are sure that the image processing will not be asynchronous, you can return a plain `number` instead.
