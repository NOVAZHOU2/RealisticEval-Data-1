Sure! Hereâ€™s how you can change the JavaScript function signature to a Java method signature, while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Finds matching elements and their indices in the input array
 * based on the specified comparison function.
 *
 * @param arr - The input array to search through.
 * @param comparisonFn - The comparison function to determine matches.
 * @return - A list of objects, each containing the matched element and its index.
 */
public static List<MatchResult> findMatchingElements(Object[] arr, Predicate<Object> comparisonFn) {
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Method Modifier**: Added `public static` to indicate visibility and that it belongs to the class.
- **Return Type**: Changed from `Array` to `List<MatchResult>`.
- **Parameter Types**: Changed `Array` to `Object[]` and `Function` to `Predicate<Object>`.
- **Comments**: Retained as-is for clarity.

This maintains the same structure and purpose as your original JavaScript code.
