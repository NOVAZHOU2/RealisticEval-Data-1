To convert the provided JavaScript code signature (which includes documentation) into a Python code signature with type hints and a docstring, we will use Python's type hinting for the function parameters and return types. Below is how the conversion can be structured:
JavaScript Function Signature
javascript
/**
 * Finds matching elements and their indices in the input array
 * based on the specified comparison function.
 *
 * @param {Array} arr - The input array to search through.
 * @param {Function} comparisonFn - The comparison function to determine matches.
 * @returns {Array} - An array of objects, each containing the matched element and its index.
 */
function findMatchingElements(arr, comparisonFn) {}
Converted Python Function Signature
python
from typing import List, Callable, Any, Dict

def find_matching_elements(arr: List[Any], comparison_fn: Callable[[Any], bool]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Finds matching elements and their indices in the input array
    based on the specified comparison function.

    :param arr: The input array to search through.
    :param comparison_fn: The comparison function to determine matches.
    :return: A list of dictionaries, each containing the matched element and its index.
    """
    pass  # Implement the function logic here
Breakdown of the Python Code Signature
Imports:
List, Callable, Any, and Dict are imported from the typing module to use type hints.
Function Definition:
The function name follows the Python naming convention (snake_case), so it is defined as find_matching_elements.
Parameters:
arr: List[Any]: This indicates that arr is expected to be a list that can contain any type of elements.
comparison_fn: Callable[[Any], bool]: This specifies that comparison_fn is a callable that takes one argument of any type and returns a boolean.
Return Type:
-> List[Dict[str, Any]]: This indicates that the function will return a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary will have string keys and values of any type.
Docstring:
A detailed docstring describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, similar to the JavaScript comments.
Function Body:
The body of the function currently has a pass statement, which you would replace with the actual implementation.
This structure maintains the purpose and documentation style from the JavaScript version while adapting it to Python's conventions.
