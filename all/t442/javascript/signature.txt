Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert strings in nested structures (e.g., objects, arrays) to numbers (integers or floating-point numbers) as much as possible.
 *
 * @param {Object|Array} data - The data before conversion.
 * @returns {Object|Array} - The data after conversion.
 */
function convertStringsToNumbers(data) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This function signature and the JSDoc comments accurately reflect the original Python function's purpose and structure.
