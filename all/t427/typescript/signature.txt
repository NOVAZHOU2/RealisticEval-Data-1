Sure, here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Read multiple sequences from the file and determine if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship,
 * that is, for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * 
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is Munodi sequence
 * 
 * @param filename - File path
 * @returns A dictionary where keys are the sequences and values indicate whether they are Munodi sequences
 */
function checkSequences(filename: string): { [key: string]: boolean };
```

In TypeScript, we use an interface or type alias to define the structure of the return value. Here, I've used a type alias `{ [key: string]: boolean }` which represents an object where the keys are strings and the values are booleans. This corresponds to the Python `Dict[str, bool]`.
