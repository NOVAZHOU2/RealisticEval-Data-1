Sure, here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript code signature while keeping the comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads multiple sequences from the file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship, that is,
 * for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * 
 * Example: [2, 4, 6, 8] is a Munodi sequence.
 * 
 * @param {string} filename - File path.
 * @returns {Object} - Object containing sequences and whether they are Munodi sequences.
 */
function checkSequences(filename) {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

This JavaScript function `checkSequences` takes a single argument `filename`, which is a string representing the file path. It returns an object where the keys are the sequences read from the file and the values indicate whether each sequence is a Munodi sequence.
