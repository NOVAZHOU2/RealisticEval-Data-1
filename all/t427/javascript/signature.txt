Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads multiple sequences from the file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * A Munodi sequence is defined by a specific recursive relationship: 
 * for even numbers, the next term is half of it; for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1;
 * the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The file path.
 * @returns {Object} An object indicating whether each sequence is a Munodi sequence.
 */
function checkSequences(filename) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

Note that I've renamed the function `check_sequences` to `checkSequences` to follow camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript. The rest of the comments have been translated into JSDoc format, which is widely adopted in JavaScript for documenting code.
