Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc format:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

/**
 * Reads sequences from a file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship,
 * that is, for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The file path containing the sequences.
 * @returns {Object} An object mapping each sequence to a boolean indicating whether it is a Munodi sequence.
 */
function checkSequences(filename) {
    const sequences = readSequencesFromFile(filename);
    const results = {};
    for (const seq of sequences) {
        results[JSON.stringify(seq)] = isMunodiSequence(seq);
    }
    return results;
}

/**
 * Reads sequences from a file and returns them as an array of arrays.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The file path containing the sequences.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} An array of sequences, where each sequence is an array of integers.
 */
function readSequencesFromFile(filename) {
    const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');
    const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
    const sequences = [];

    for (const line of lines) {
        const seq = line.trim().split(',').map(num => parseInt(num, 10));
        sequences.push(seq);
    }
    return sequences;
}

/**
 * Checks if the given sequence is a Munodi sequence.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} sequence - The sequence to check.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the sequence is a Munodi sequence, false otherwise.
 */
function isMunodiSequence(sequence) {
    if (sequence.length < 2) {
        return false;  // A sequence with less than 2 elements cannot be a Munodi sequence
    }

    const commonDifference = sequence[1] - sequence[0];
    for (let i = 2; i < sequence.length; i++) {
        if (sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] !== commonDifference) {
            return false;  // Found a different difference, not a Munodi sequence
        }
    }
    return true;  // All differences are the same
}

// Example usage
const filename = 'sequences.txt';
console.log(checkSequences(filename));
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comments provide detailed descriptions of the functions, their parameters, and return types.
   - The comments are structured to follow standard JSDoc conventions.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `checkSequences`: This function reads sequences from a file and determines if each sequence is a Munodi sequence. It uses the helper functions `readSequencesFromFile` and `isMunodiSequence`.
   - `readSequencesFromFile`: This function reads the content of the file, splits it into lines, and converts each line into an array of integers.
   - `isMunodiSequence`: This function checks if a given sequence is a Munodi sequence based on the specified recursive relationship.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - The example usage demonstrates how to call the `checkSequences` function with a filename and log the results.

This code preserves the original functionality and structure while adhering to JavaScript best practices and documentation standards.
