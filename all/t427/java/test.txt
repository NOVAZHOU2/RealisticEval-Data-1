Sure, here's how you can convert your Python unittest test class into a Java JUnit test case:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Tester {

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckSequences() {
        // Assuming there's a method called checkSequences in a class named SequenceChecker
        // Replace the following with actual logic or mock objects if necessary
        boolean result = SequenceChecker.checkSequences("path/to/file.txt");
        assertTrue(result); // Adjust the assertion based on expected outcome
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we have used JUnit annotations `@Before` and `@Test`. The `setUp()` method is annotated with `@Before`, which means it will be run before each test method. The `testCheckSequences()` method is annotated with `@Test`, indicating that it is a test method.

Please note that you need to replace `SequenceChecker.checkSequences("path/to/file.txt")` with the actual implementation or mock object if necessary. Also, adjust the assertion (`assertTrue(result)`) based on the expected outcome of your `checkSequences` function.
