Sure, hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code for the given Python function:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class SequenceChecker {

    /**
     * Read multiple sequences from the file and determine if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
     * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship,
     * that is, for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
     * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
     * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
     *
     * @param filename the file path containing the sequences
     * @return a map where keys are sequence identifiers and values indicate whether the sequence is a Munodi sequence
     */
    public static Map<String, Boolean> checkSequences(String filename) {
        Map<String, Boolean> results = new HashMap<>();

        // Implementation logic goes here

        return results;
    }

    // Example usage or additional methods can be added here
}
```

In this Java version:
- The function `check_sequences` has been renamed to `checkSequences` to follow Java naming conventions.
- The Python `Dict` type annotation has been translated to a `Map<String, Boolean>` in Java.
- The docstring has been converted into a Javadoc comment with the necessary sections for description, parameters, and return value.
- The import statements required for handling files and maps have been included.

The actual implementation logic inside the method would depend on how you read the file and process the sequences, which is not provided in the Python snippet. You would need to add the necessary logic for reading the file and determining whether each sequence is a Munodi sequence.
