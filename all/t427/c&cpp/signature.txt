```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

/**
 * Read multiple sequences from the file and determine if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship, that is,
 * for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1, 
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is Mundi sequence
 *
 * @param filename string representing the file path
 * @return unordered_map<string, bool> indicating whether each sequence is a Munodi sequence or not
 */
std::unordered_map<std::string, bool> checkSequences(const std::string& filename);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same logic as your Python function but in C++. It reads sequences from a file and checks if they follow the Munodi sequence rules. The result is returned in an `unordered_map` where the keys are the sequence identifiers (from the file) and the values indicate whether the sequence is a Munodi sequence (`true`) or not (`false`).
