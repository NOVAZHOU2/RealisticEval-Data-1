Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ test class using the Catch2 testing framework. The provided Python unittest class will be converted into a Catch2 test case, ensuring that the functionality and logic of the tests are preserved.

### C++ Code with Catch2 Testing Framework

First, make sure you have Catch2 installed and included in your project. You can include Catch2 via a header-only library or through a package manager.

Here is the complete C++ code:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <filesystem>

// Function to read sequences from a file and return them as a vector of vectors.
std::vector<std::vector<int>> read_sequences_from_file(const std::string& filename) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> sequences;
    std::ifstream file(filename);
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening file: " << filename << std::endl;
        return sequences;
    }

    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(file, line)) {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        std::vector<int> seq;
        std::string number;
        while (std::getline(iss, number, ',')) {
            seq.push_back(std::stoi(number));
        }
        sequences.push_back(seq);
    }
    file.close();
    return sequences;
}

// Function to check if the given sequence is a Munodi sequence.
bool is_munodi_sequence(const std::vector<int>& sequence) {
    if (sequence.size() < 2) {
        return false; // A sequence with less than 2 elements cannot be a Munodi sequence
    }

    int current = sequence[0];
    for (size_t i = 1; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        int next = sequence[i];
        if (current == 1) {
            return false; // Sequence should terminate at 1
        }
        if (current % 2 == 0 && next != current / 2) {
            return false; // For even numbers, the next term should be half of it
        } else if (current % 2 != 0 && next != 3 * current + 1) {
            return false; // For odd numbers, the next term should be 3*n + 1
        }
        current = next;
    }
    return current == 1; // The sequence should end with 1
}

// Function to read sequences from a file and determine if each sequence is a Munodi sequence.
std::map<std::vector<int>, bool> check_sequences(const std::string& filename) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> sequences = read_sequences_from_file(filename);
    std::map<std::vector<int>, bool> results;

    for (const auto& seq : sequences) {
        results[seq] = is_munodi_sequence(seq);
    }
    return results;
}

TEST_CASE("TestCheckSequences", "[check_sequences]") {
    // Set up the test cases with sequences.
    std::string test_file = "test_sequences.dat";

    // Write test sequences to the file
    std::ofstream f(test_file);
    f << "2,4,6,8\n";    // Munodi sequence (d = 2)
    f << "1,3,5,7\n";    // Munodi sequence (d = 2)
    f << "10,20,30\n";   // Munodi sequence (d = 10)
    f << "1,2,4,8\n";    // Not a Munodi sequence (d changes)
    f << "5,10,15,20\n"; // Munodi sequence (d = 5)
    f.close();

    // Expected results
    std::map<std::vector<int>, bool> expected_results = {
        {{2, 4, 6, 8}, true},
        {{1, 3, 5, 7}, true},
        {{10, 20, 30}, true},
        {{1, 2, 4, 8}, false},
        {{5, 10, 15, 20}, true}
    };

    // Check the sequences
    auto results = check_sequences(test_file);
    for (const auto& [seq, expected] : expected_results) {
        REQUIRE(results.find(seq) != results.end());
        CHECK(results.at(seq) == expected);
    }

    // Clean up the test file after tests
    std::filesystem::remove(test_file);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Catch2 Test Case**: The `TEST_CASE` macro is used to define a test case.
2. **Setup**: The test file is created and populated with test sequences.
3. **Expected Results**: The expected results are defined as a map of sequences and their expected boolean values.
4. **Check Sequences**: The `check_sequences` function is called, and the results are compared against the expected results using Catch2 assertions.
5. **Cleanup**: The test file is removed after the tests are completed.

### Running the Tests
To run the tests, you need to link against Catch2 and compile your code. Here is an example of how to do this using a simple CMake setup:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(CheckSequencesTests)

# Add Catch2
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    catch2
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
    GIT_TAG v2.13.8
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(catch2)

# Add executable
add_executable(CheckSequencesTests main.cpp)

# Link Catch2
target_link_libraries(CheckSequencesTests PUBLIC catch2)

# Run tests
add_test(NAME CheckSequencesTests COMMAND CheckSequencesTests)
```

This setup ensures that the tests are compiled and executed properly. You can then run the tests using CMake or another build system.
