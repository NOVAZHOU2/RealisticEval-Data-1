Here is the equivalent C++ code signature:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Convert a list of hole positions to the ring format (vector of 1s and 0s).
 *
 * @param holes A vector of integers representing the positions of the holes (0-indexed).
 * @return A vector of length 32, where positions with holes are 0 and others are 1.
 */
std::vector<int> convertToRingFormat(const std::vector<int>& holes);
```

Note that in C++, we use `std::vector` instead of Python's built-in `list`, and we pass it as a constant reference (`const std::vector<int>&`) to avoid copying the entire vector when passing it to the function. The return type is also `std::vector<int>` which represents the ring format.
