Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert an array of hole positions to the ring format (array of 1s and 0s).
 *
 * @param {number[]} holes - An array of integers representing the positions of the holes (0-indexed).
 * @returns {number[]} An array of length 32, where positions with holes are 0 and others are 1.
 */
function convertToRingFormat(holes) {
    // Initialize the ring with all positions set to 1
    let ring = new Array(32).fill(1);

    // Mark the positions of holes as 0
    for (let hole of holes) {
        if (0 <= hole && hole < 32) {  // Ensure hole positions are within valid range
            ring[hole] = 0;
        }
    }

    return ring;
}
```

In this JavaScript code:
- The function `convert_to_ring_format` is renamed to `convertToRingFormat` to follow camelCase naming conventions commonly used in JavaScript.
- The JSDoc comment block is added to provide clear documentation for the function parameters and return type.
- The function body remains the same, preserving the logic and structure of the original Python code.
