Here’s the equivalent Java version of the provided C++ function signature, including Javadoc comments:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * @brief Calculates the steering angle based on the given angular velocity, speed, and wheelbase.
 *
 * The method uses the relationship between angular velocity, speed, and the steering angle
 * to determine the appropriate steering angle required for the vehicle to achieve the desired
 * angular velocity. The formula used is:
 *
 *      ω = (v / L) * tan(δ)
 *
 * Rearranging gives us:
 *
 *      δ = atan((ω * L) / v)
 *
 * @param angularVelocity The angular velocity of the vehicle in radians per second.
 * @param speed The forward speed of the vehicle in meters per second.
 * @param wheelbase The distance between the front and rear axles of the vehicle in meters.
 *
 * @return The steering angle in radians.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if speed is less than or equal to zero,
 *                                   since the vehicle cannot move at zero or negative speed.
 */
public static double calculateSteeringAngle(double angularVelocity, double speed, double wheelbase) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the functionality and structure of the original C++ code while adhering to Java conventions. Let me know if you need any further modifications or details!
