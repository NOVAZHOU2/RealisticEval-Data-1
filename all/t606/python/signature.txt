Converted Python Code Signature
python
import math

def calculate_steering_angle(angular_velocity: float, speed: float, wheelbase: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the steering angle based on the given angular velocity, speed, and wheelbase.

    The function uses the relationship between angular velocity, speed, and the steering angle
    to determine the appropriate steering angle required for the vehicle to achieve the desired
    angular velocity. The formula used is:

         ω = (v / L) * tan(δ)

    Rearranging gives us:

         δ = atan((ω * L) / v)

    Parameters:
    angular_velocity (float): The angular velocity of the vehicle in radians per second.
    speed (float): The forward speed of the vehicle in meters per second.
    wheelbase (float): The distance between the front and rear axles of the vehicle in meters.

    Returns:
    float: The steering angle in radians.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If speed is less than or equal to zero,
                since the vehicle cannot move at zero or negative speed.

    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Import Statements:
The math module is imported for mathematical functions, specifically for atan in the implementation.
Function Definition:
The function name calculate_steering_angle follows Python's snake_case naming convention.
Type hints are added for the parameters and return type.
Docstring:
The C++ comments have been converted to a Python docstring format, using triple quotes.
The parameter descriptions and return values are adjusted to match Python conventions.
The exception raised is described in the Raises section of the docstring.
Implementation Placeholder:
A placeholder pass statement is included where the function implementation will go.
Usage Example
Here’s how you could later implement and call this function in your Python script:
python
def calculate_steering_angle(angular_velocity: float, speed: float, wheelbase: float) -> float:
    if speed <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Speed must be greater than zero.")
    
    # Calculate steering angle in radians
    steering_angle = math.atan((angular_velocity * wheelbase) / speed)
    
    return steering_angle

# Example of using the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        angle = calculate_steering_angle(1.0, 10.0, 2.0)
        print(f"The steering angle is: {angle} radians")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
This example includes a basic implementation of the function and demonstrates how to handle the exception if the speed is invalid.
