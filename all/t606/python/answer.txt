Here’s the provided C++ code translated into Python, with appropriate handling for exceptions and using Python's built-in functions.
Converted Python Code
python
import math

def calculate_steering_angle(angular_velocity: float, speed: float, wheelbase: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the steering angle based on angular velocity, speed, and wheelbase.

    :param angular_velocity: The angular velocity in radians per second.
    :param speed: The speed in meters per second.
    :param wheelbase: The distance between the front and rear wheels in meters.

    :return: The calculated steering angle in radians.

    :raises ValueError: If speed is less than or equal to zero, since it must be greater than zero.
    """
    # Check for valid speed
    if speed <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Speed must be greater than zero.")
    
    # Calculate steering angle in radians
    steering_angle = math.atan((angular_velocity * wheelbase) / speed)
    
    return steering_angle  # Returns the steering angle in radians
Explanation of Changes:
Import Statements:
Imported the math module to access the atan function for calculating the arctangent.
Function Definition:
The function name is changed to calculate_steering_angle following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type hints are added for the function parameters and return type.
Exception Handling:
Changed std::invalid_argument to ValueError to match Python’s exception types.
The error message remains the same, indicating that the speed must be greater than zero.
Calculating Steering Angle:
The calculation remains the same, using math.atan() to compute the steering angle in radians.
Docstring:
A docstring is added to describe the function, its parameters, return value, and the exceptions it may raise.
Usage Example
Here’s an example of how you might use this function in a Python script:
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        angle = calculate_steering_angle(1.0, 10.0, 2.0)
        print(f"The steering angle is: {angle} radians")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
This example attempts to calculate the steering angle and prints the result or an error message if the speed is invalid.
