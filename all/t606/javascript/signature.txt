Here’s the equivalent JavaScript function with the appropriate comments and structure:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the steering angle based on the given angular velocity, speed, and wheelbase.
 *
 * The function uses the relationship between angular velocity, speed, and the steering angle
 * to determine the appropriate steering angle required for the vehicle to achieve the desired
 * angular velocity. The formula used is:
 *
 *      ω = (v / L) * tan(δ)
 *
 * Rearranging gives us:
 *
 *      δ = atan((ω * L) / v)
 *
 * @param {number} angularVelocity The angular velocity of the vehicle in radians per second.
 * @param {number} speed The forward speed of the vehicle in meters per second.
 * @param {number} wheelbase The distance between the front and rear axles of the vehicle in meters.
 *
 * @return {number} The steering angle in radians.
 *
 * @throws {Error} If speed is less than or equal to zero,
 *                 since the vehicle cannot move at zero or negative speed.
 */
function calculateSteeringAngle(angularVelocity, speed, wheelbase) {
    // Check for valid speed
    if (speed <= 0) {
        throw new Error("Speed must be greater than zero.");
    }

    // Calculate steering angle in radians
    const steeringAngle = Math.atan((angularVelocity * wheelbase) / speed);

    return steeringAngle; // Returns the steering angle in radians
}
```

This code maintains the original functionality and adapts it to JavaScript conventions. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
