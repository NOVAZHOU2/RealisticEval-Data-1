Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Java JUnit test cases into Python unittest test cases.
Converted Python Code using unittest
python
import unittest

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):
    # Tolerance level for floating-point comparisons
    TOLERANCE = 1e-6

    def test_find_t_for_x_at_start(self):
        p0 = 0.0
        p1 = 0.5
        p2 = 1.0
        target_x = 0.0
        t = Answer.find_t_for_x(target_x, p0, p1, p2)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(t, 0.0, delta=self.TOLERANCE)

    def test_find_t_for_x_at_end(self):
        p0 = 0.0
        p1 = 0.5
        p2 = 1.0
        target_x = 1.0
        t = Answer.find_t_for_x(target_x, p0, p1, p2)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(t, 1.0, delta=self.TOLERANCE)

    def test_find_t_for_x_mid_curve(self):
        p0 = 0.0
        p1 = 0.5
        p2 = 1.0
        target_x = 0.25
        t = Answer.find_t_for_x(target_x, p0, p1, p2)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(t, 0.25, delta=self.TOLERANCE)

    def test_find_t_for_x_near_mid_curve(self):
        p0 = 0.0
        p1 = 1.0
        p2 = 2.0
        target_x = 1.5
        t = Answer.find_t_for_x(target_x, p0, p1, p2)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(t, 0.75, delta=self.TOLERANCE)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Conversion:
Importing Libraries:
In Python, we import the unittest module.
Test Class Declaration:
The Java class Tester is converted into a Python class TestAnswer which inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Static Variables:
The TOLERANCE constant in Java is defined as a class-level constant in Python.
Test Method Naming:
Each Java test method annotated with @Test is converted to a Python method prefixed with test_. This is how the unittest framework identifies test methods.
Assertions:
In Java, assertEquals is used to compare expected and actual values. In Python's unittest, the equivalent is assertAlmostEqual, which is particularly useful for comparing floating-point numbers with a specified tolerance.
Running the Tests:
The conditional block if __name__ == '__main__': allows you to run the tests when the script is executed directly.
Running the Tests
To run the test cases, save the code in a Python file (for example, test_answer.py) and execute it using:
bash
python -m unittest test_answer.py
This will execute the test cases and provide you with the results.
