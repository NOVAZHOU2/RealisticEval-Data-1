To convert the Java function signature to a Python code signature, we need to adjust the syntax to follow Python conventions. The main differences involve changing the types, removing the visibility modifiers (public, static), and using Python's def keyword instead of Java's method declaration. Here's how you can rewrite the provided Java function signature in Python:
python
def find_t_for_x(target_x: float, p0: float, p1: float, p2: float) -> float:
    pass
Explanation:
Function Definition: The def keyword is used in Python to define a function.
Function Name: In Python, it's common to use lowercase with underscores for function names (snake_case) instead of camelCase.
Parameter Types: We specify the parameter types using type hints:
target_x: float indicates that target_x is expected to be a float.
p0: float, p1: float, p2: float similarly indicate that these parameters are also floats.
Return Type: The -> float at the end specifies that the function will return a float.
Function Body: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function body, which you would replace with the actual implementation.
This Python signature retains the same functionality intended in the Java version while conforming to Python syntax and conventions.
