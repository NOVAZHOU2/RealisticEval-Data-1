/**
 * Finds the parameter `t` corresponding to a given x-coordinate `targetX`
 * on a quadratic Bézier curve defined by control points p0, p1, and p2.
 * The function uses the secant method to iteratively approach the value of `t`
 * where the Bézier curve intersects with the vertical line at `targetX`.
 *
 * @param targetX The x-coordinate for which we want to find the corresponding
 *                parameter `t` on the Bézier curve.
 * @param p0 The first control point of the Bézier curve, representing the
 *            starting point.
 * @param p1 The second control point of the Bézier curve, affecting the curve's
 *            shape.
 * @param p2 The third control point of the Bézier curve, representing the
 *            ending point.
 * @return The parameter `t` (in the range [0, 1]) for which the Bézier curve
 *         evaluated at `t` is closest to `targetX`. If no precise value is
 *         found within the specified tolerance and iterations, the function
 *         returns the best approximation.
