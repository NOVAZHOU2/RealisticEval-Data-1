Here’s the equivalent C++ version of the provided Python function signature, including comments and type annotations translated appropriately:

```cpp
#include <tuple>

// Function to find the parameter t corresponding to a given x-coordinate target_x
// on a quadratic Bézier curve defined by control points p0, p1, and p2.
/**
 * Find the parameter t corresponding to a given x-coordinate target_x
 * on a quadratic Bézier curve defined by control points p0, p1, and p2.
 *
 * @param target_x The x-coordinate for which we want to find the corresponding parameter t.
 * @param p0 The first control point of the Bézier curve.
 * @param p1 The second control point of the Bézier curve.
 * @param p2 The third control point of the Bézier curve.
 * @return The parameter t (in the range [0, 1]) for which the Bézier curve
 *         evaluated at t is closest to target_x.
 */
double find_t_for_x(double target_x, std::tuple<double, double> p0, std::tuple<double, double> p1, std::tuple<double, double> p2);
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Type Annotations**: Python type annotations (like `float` and `Tuple`) are translated to their C++ equivalents (`double` and `std::tuple<double, double>`).
2. **Docstrings**: The Python docstring is converted into a C++ comment block using `/** */`, which is the standard for documenting functions in C++.
3. **Function Signature**: The function retains its purpose and structure, and the parameter types are explicitly defined.

This code snippet can be incorporated into a C++ program as part of the larger implementation.
