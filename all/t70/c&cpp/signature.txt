Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments kept intact:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/**
 * Extracts the contents of the code block from the given Markdown string.
 *
 * @param markdown_string The input markdown string.
 * @return A vector of strings, each representing the content of a code block.
 *         Returns an empty vector if no code blocks are found.
 */
std::vector<std::string> codeBlockRemover(const std::string& markdownString);
```

This C++ function signature does not include the implementation details but follows the same structure and purpose as the original Python function.
