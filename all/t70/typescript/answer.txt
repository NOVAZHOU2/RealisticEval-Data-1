Here is how you can convert the Python code to TypeScript:

```typescript
function codeBlockRemover(markdownString: string): string[] {
    /**
     * Extracts the contents of the code block from the given Markdown string.
     *
     * @param {string} markdownString - The input markdown string.
     * @returns {string[]} An array of strings, each representing the content of a code block.
     *                    Returns an empty array if no code blocks are found.
     */
}
```

Note that in TypeScript, we don't need to explicitly specify the return type of functions like in Python, because TypeScript has static type checking. However, it's still good practice to include it for clarity and to help other developers understand what your function is expected to return.
