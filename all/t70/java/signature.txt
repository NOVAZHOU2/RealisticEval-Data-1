Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class CodeBlockRemover {

    /**
     * Extracts the contents of the code block from the given Markdown string.
     *
     * @param markdownString The input markdown string.
     * @return A list of strings, each representing the content of a code block.
     *         Returns an empty list if no code blocks are found.
     */
    public static List<String> codeBlockRemover(String markdownString) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Note that in Java, we use `static` methods for utility functions like this one, which doesn't depend on any instance variables. Also, Java does not have a built-in way to return multiple values from a function like Python's `List`, so you would need to handle this differently in your actual implementation.
