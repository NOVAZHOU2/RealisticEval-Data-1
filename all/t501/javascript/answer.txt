Sure! I'll convert the given Python function to a JavaScript function, maintaining the same functionality, logic, and structure. Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
function convertToShortFormat(inputStr) {
    /**
     * Converts a string concatenated with underscores to a short format.
     *
     * @param {string} inputStr - The input string with segments separated by underscores.
     * @return {string} A short format string derived from the first characters of each segment.
     */
    // Split the input string by underscores
    const segments = inputStr.split('_');

    // Extract the first character from each segment and join them
    const shortFormat = segments.map(segment => segment[0]).join('');

    return shortFormat;
}
```

This JavaScript function `convertToShortFormat` performs the same operations as the provided Python function, including splitting the input string by underscores, extracting the first character from each segment, and joining those characters to form the short format string.
