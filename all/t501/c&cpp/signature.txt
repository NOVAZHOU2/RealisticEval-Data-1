```cpp
/**
 * Converts a string concatenated with underscores to a short format.
 * For example:
 *     input: "f1_p1_g1_b1_c1"
 *     output: "fpgbc"
 *
 * @param input_str The input string with segments separated by underscores.
 * @return A short format string derived from the first characters of each segment.
 */
std::string convertToShortFormat(const std::string& inputStr);
```

This is the C++ function signature equivalent to your Python function, preserving the docstring for clarity and keeping the function's purpose and parameters consistent. Note that in C++, we use `const std::string&` to pass the input string by reference, which is more efficient than copying large strings, and we return a `std::string`.
