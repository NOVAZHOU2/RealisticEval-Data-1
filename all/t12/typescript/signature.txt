Here's how you can translate the Python function signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two agents based on their coordinates in the observations.
 *
 * @param agent1 - String representation of agent1's identifier.
 * @param agent2 - String representation of agent2's identifier.
 * @param observations - Dictionary containing observation question with agent identifiers as keys. Each value is a dictionary with 'x' and 'y' keys representing coordinates.
 * @returns The Euclidean distance between the two agents.
 */
function calculateDistance(agent1: string, agent2: string, observations: { [key: string]: { x: number; y: number } }): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- `agent1` and `agent2` are both strings.
- `observations` is an object where each key is a string (representing an agent's identifier), and each value is another object with `x` and `y` properties that are numbers.
- The return type of the function is `number`, which represents the Euclidean distance.
