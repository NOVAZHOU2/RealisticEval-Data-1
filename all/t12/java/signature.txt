Sure! Below is the Java code signature for the given Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two agents based on their coordinates in the observations.
 *
 * @param agent1 String representation of agent1's identifier.
 * @param agent2 String representation of agent2's identifier.
 * @param observations Dictionary containing observation questions with agent identifiers as keys.
 *                    Each value is a dictionary with 'x' and 'y' keys representing coordinates.
 * @return double: Euclidean distance between the two agents.
 */
public static double calculateDistance(String agent1, String agent2, Map<String, Map<String, Double>> observations) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Java Comments**: The method documentation follows the Javadoc format, which is commonly used in Java to document methods, classes, and fields.
- **Method Signature**:
  - `public static`: This makes the method accessible from anywhere within the application.
  - `double`: The return type is `double` because it represents a floating-point number.
  - `calculateDistance`: The name of the method.
  - `String agent1`, `String agent2`, `Map<String, Map<String, Double>> observations`: These are the parameters of the method. `agent1` and `agent2` are strings representing the identifiers of the agents, and `observations` is a map where each key is an agent identifier and the value is another map containing the coordinates ('x' and 'y') of that agent.

This Java method signature should be placed inside a class to be fully functional.
