/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two agents based on their coordinates in the observations.
 *
 * @param {string} agent1 - String representation of agent1's identifier.
 * @param {string} agent2 - String representation of agent2's identifier.
 * @param {Object} observations - Object containing observation data with agent identifiers as keys.
 *                                Each value is an object with 'x' and 'y' properties representing coordinates.
 * @returns {number} Euclidean distance between the two agents.
