Sure! Here is the JavaScript version of your Python function signature, keeping the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two agents based on their coordinates in the observations.
 *
 * @param {string} agent1 - String representation of agent1's identifier.
 * @param {string} agent2 - String representation of agent2's identifier.
 * @param {Object.<string, Object.<string, number>>} observations - Dictionary containing observation questions with agent identifiers as keys. Each value is an object with 'x' and 'y' keys representing coordinates.
 * @returns {number} - Euclidean distance between the two agents.
 */
function calculateDistance(agent1, agent2, observations) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature maintains the same structure and documentation as your original Python function.
