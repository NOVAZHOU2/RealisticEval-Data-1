Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python function, including the JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the Euclidean distance between two agents based on their coordinates in the observations.
 *
 * @param {string} agent1 - String representation of agent1's identifier.
 * @param {string} agent2 - String representation of agent2's identifier.
 * @param {Object} observations - Object containing observation data with agent identifiers as keys.
 *                                Each value is an object with 'x' and 'y' properties representing coordinates.
 * @returns {number} Euclidean distance between the two agents.
 */
function calculateDistance(agent1, agent2, observations) {
    // Extract coordinates of both agents
    const x1 = observations[agent1].x;
    const y1 = observations[agent1].y;
    const x2 = observations[agent2].x;
    const y2 = observations[agent2].y;

    // Calculate the Euclidean distance
    const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x1 - x2, 2) + Math.pow(y1 - y2, 2));

    return distance;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block is placed at the beginning of the function.
   - The `@param` tags describe the parameters and their types.
   - The `@returns` tag describes the return type and value.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `calculateDistance` is defined with parameters `agent1`, `agent2`, and `observations`.

3. **Coordinate Extraction**:
   - The coordinates `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are extracted from the `observations` object using the agent identifiers.

4. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**:
   - The Euclidean distance is calculated using the `Math.sqrt` and `Math.pow` functions.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The calculated distance is returned by the function.

This JavaScript function preserves the purpose, structure, and functionality of the original Python function, and the comments are formatted according to JSDoc standards.
