Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code for the provided C++ function, following your instructions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Converts a hue value to its corresponding RGB color values.
 *
 * @param hue A float representing the hue angle in degrees,
 *            expected to be in the range [0, 360).
 *
 * @return An array containing three integers representing the
 *         RGB color components in the range [0, 255]. The
 *         first element is the red component, the second
 *         element is the green component, and the third element
 *         is the blue component.

    public static int[] hueToRGB(float hue) {

        float r, g, b;

        // Calculate RGB values based on hue
        int sector = (int) (hue / 60);

### Key Changes:
- The `std::tuple` was replaced with an `int[]` array for the return type.
- The method and class were structured according to Java conventions, including the use of the `public` access modifier.
- Comments were converted to Javadoc format.
- Type annotations were adjusted to Java syntax, such as using `int` instead of `static_cast<int>`.
