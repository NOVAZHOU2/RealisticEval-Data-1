Hereâ€™s the converted JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a hue value to its corresponding RGB color values.
 *
 * @param {number} hue - A float representing the hue angle in degrees,
 *                       expected to be in the range [0, 360).
 *
 * @return {Array<number>} An array containing three integers representing the
 *                         RGB color components in the range [0, 255]. The
 *                         first element is the red component, the second
 *                         element is the green component, and the third element
 *                         is the blue component.
 */
function hueToRGB(hue) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
``` 

Let me know if you need the full implementation translated as well!
