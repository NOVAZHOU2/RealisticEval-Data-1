Hereâ€™s the converted Python code signature based on the provided C++ code, with comments adjusted to Python style:
python
from typing import Tuple

def hue_to_rgb(hue: float) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """
    Converts a hue value to its corresponding RGB color values.

    :param hue: A float representing the hue angle in degrees,
                 expected to be in the range [0, 360).
    :return: A tuple containing three integers representing the
             RGB color components in the range [0, 255]. The
             first element is the red component, the second
             element is the green component, and the third element
             is the blue component.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Changes Explained:
Imports:
The Tuple type is imported from the typing module for type hinting.
Function Definition:
The function name is changed from hueToRGB to hue_to_rgb to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
The parameter type is specified as float, and the return type is specified as Tuple[int, int, int].
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted to a Python docstring format using triple quotes """.
The @param and @return annotations are replaced with :param and :return respectively, which is the common format in Python documentation.
Implementation Placeholder:
The function body contains a pass statement, indicating that the implementation should be added here later.
This signature sets up the function for further development and maintains clarity with appropriate comments.
