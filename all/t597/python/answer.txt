Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function that converts hue to RGB values. I've translated the logic and comments while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions:
python
import math
from typing import Tuple

def hue_to_rgb(hue: float) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """ 
    Ensure the hue value is within the range [0, 360).
    """
    hue = hue % 360.0  # Ensure hue is within [0, 360)
    if hue < 0:
        hue += 360.0

    # Calculate RGB values based on hue
    sector = int(hue / 60)  # Determine the sector
    fractional = (hue / 60) - sector  # Calculate the fractional part

    # Initialize RGB values
    if sector == 0:
        r, g, b = 1.0, fractional, 0.0  # Red to Yellow
    elif sector == 1:
        r, g, b = 1.0 - fractional, 1.0, 0.0  # Yellow to Green
    elif sector == 2:
        r, g, b = 0.0, 1.0, fractional  # Green to Cyan
    elif sector == 3:
        r, g, b = 0.0, 1.0 - fractional, 1.0  # Cyan to Blue
    elif sector == 4:
        r, g, b = fractional, 0.0, 1.0  # Blue to Magenta
    else:
        r, g, b = 1.0, 0.0, 1.0 - fractional  # Magenta to Red

    # Convert to 0-255 range
    red = int(r * 255)
    green = int(g * 255)
    blue = int(b * 255)

    return red, green, blue  # Return RGB as a tuple
Key Changes Explained:
Imports:
Imported math for mathematical functions and Tuple from typing for type hinting.
Function Definition:
The function name is changed to hue_to_rgb, which follows Python's naming convention.
The return type is specified as Tuple[int, int, int] to indicate the function returns a tuple of three integers.
Hue Normalization:
Used the modulus operator % to ensure the hue value is within the range [0, 360).
Sector Calculation:
The sector is calculated using int(hue / 60).
RGB Calculation:
The switch-case structure in C++ is replaced with an if-elif structure in Python.
Final RGB Values:
Converted the RGB values to integers in the range of 0 to 255.
Return Statement:
The function returns a tuple (red, green, blue).
Usage Example:
You can call this function as follows:
python
red, green, blue = hue_to_rgb(120.0)  # Example for hue of 120 degrees (Green)
print(f"RGB: ({red}, {green}, {blue})")  # Output will be RGB values
This Python function works in the same way as the original C++ function, converting a hue value to its corresponding RGB values.
