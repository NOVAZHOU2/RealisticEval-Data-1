Sure! Below is the Python equivalent of the provided Java JUnit test case using the unittest framework. I have created a class named Answer with a nested class Point to simulate the structure of the Java code. Additionally, I implemented the findKNearestNeighbors method and the contains_point function.
Here's the complete Python code:
python
import unittest
import math

class Answer:
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    def findKNearestNeighbors(self, points, queryPoint, k):
        # Calculate distances from the query point to each point
        distances = [(point, self._euclidean_distance(point, queryPoint)) for point in points]
        
        # Sort points by distance
        distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Get the k nearest neighbors
        nearest_neighbors = [distances[i][0] for i in range(min(k, len(distances)))]
        return nearest_neighbors

    def _euclidean_distance(self, point1, point2):
        return math.sqrt((point1.x - point2.x) ** 2 + (point1.y - point2.y) ** 2)

class Tester(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_find_k_nearest_neighbors_simple_case(self):
        knn = Answer()
        points = [
            Answer.Point(1, 2),
            Answer.Point(3, 4),
            Answer.Point(1, -1),
            Answer.Point(5, 2)
        ]
        query_point = Answer.Point(2, 2)
        k = 2
        result = knn.findKNearestNeighbors(points, query_point, k)
        
        self.assertEqual(len(result), 2)
        self.assertTrue(self.contains_point(result, Answer.Point(1, 2)))
        self.assertTrue(self.contains_point(result, Answer.Point(3, 4)))

    def test_find_k_nearest_neighbors_exact_match(self):
        knn = Answer()
        points = [

        k = 1
        result = knn.findKNearestNeighbors(points, query_point, k)
        
        self.assertEqual(len(result), 1)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(result[0].x, 2.0, delta=0.001)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(result[0].y, 2.0, delta=0.001)

    def test_find_k_nearest_neighbors_larger_k(self):

                return True
        return False

Explanation:
Class Structure: The Answer class contains the Point nested class to represent a point in 2D space.
Distance Calculation: The _euclidean_distance method calculates the distance between two points, which is used in findKNearestNeighbors.
Test Cases: Each test case from the Java code is translated to a method in the Tester class.
Assertions: The assertions in the Java tests are mirrored in the Python tests using assertEqual, assertAlmostEqual, and assertTrue.
contains_point Method: This method checks if a given point is present in the results, allowing for a small tolerance in comparisons.
Running the Test:
To run this test suite, save the code to a file (e.g., test_knn.py) and execute it using Python:
bash
python -m unittest test
