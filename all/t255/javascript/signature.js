/**
 * Converts a picture to an array of binary bits. It converts the image to black and white mode
 * (only 0s and 1s, where 0 corresponds to black and 1 to white), then converts the white pixels
 * (value 255) to 1 and the black pixels to 0. Finally, it stores these bits in an array and returns it.
 *
 * @param {string} imagePath - The path to the image file.
 * @returns {Array<number>} A list of bits (0 or 1) representing the image.
