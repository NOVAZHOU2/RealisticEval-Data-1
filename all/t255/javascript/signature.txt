Here is your Python function converted into JavaScript with comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a picture to an array of binary bits. It converts the image to black and white mode 
 * (only 0s and 1s, where 0 corresponds to black and 1 to white), then converts the white pixels 
 * (value 255) to 1 and the black pixels to 0. Finally, it stores these bits in an array and returns it.
 *
 * @param {string} imagePath - The path to the image file.
 * @returns {Array<number>} A list of bits (0 or 1) representing the image.
 */
function convertImageToBits(imagePath) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

Note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for type annotations like Python, so you'll need to use external tools like JSDoc or TypeScript to enforce types in your JavaScript codebase if you want to maintain consistency with your original Python code.
