Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Convert a picture to an array of binary bits. Convert it to black and white mode (only 0s and 1s, 
 * corresponding to black and white), convert the white pixel (value 255) to 1, convert the black pixel to 0, 
 * and finally store these bits in an array and return.
 *
 * @param image_path The path to the image file.
 * @return std::vector<int> A vector of bits (0 or 1) representing the image.
 */
std::vector<int> convertImageToBits(const std::string& image_path);
```

This C++ function `convertImageToBits` takes a string parameter `image_path` which represents the path to the image file. It returns a `std::vector<int>` containing the binary bits representing the image, where each bit is either 0 or 1.
