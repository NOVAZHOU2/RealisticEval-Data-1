Here's the equivalent Java code signature with comments retained:

```java
/**
 * Reorders image question based on scores in ascending order.
 *
 * @param imageScores An array of numerical scores for the images.
 * @param imageNames An array of image names corresponding to the scores.
 * @param imageIDs An array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
 * @returns A Result object containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
 */
public static Result reorderData(double[] imageScores, String[] imageNames, String[] imageIDs) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The parameter types are changed to Java types (`double[]` for scores and `String[]` for names and IDs).
- The return type is specified as `Result`, which would be a custom class you create to hold the results.
