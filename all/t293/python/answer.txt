Here is the Python version of your JavaScript function:

```python
def reorder_data(image_scores, image_names, image_ids):
    """
    Reorders image question based on scores in ascending order.

    :param image_scores: A list of numerical scores for the images.
    :type image_scores: list
    :param image_names: A list of image names corresponding to the scores.
    :type image_names: list
    :param image_ids: A list of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
    :type image_ids: list or int
    :return: An object containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
    :rtype: dict
    """

    # Combine all lists into a single list of tuples
    combined = list(zip(image_scores, image_names, image_ids))

    # Sort the combined list by the first element of each tuple (the score)
    sorted_combined = sorted(combined)

    # Unzip the sorted list back into three separate lists
    result_scores, result_names, result_ids = zip(*sorted_combined)

    return {
        'resultScores': list(result_scores),
        'resultNames': list(result_names),
        'resultIDs': list(result_ids)
    }
```

This Python function does the same thing as the original JavaScript function. It takes three parameters (`image_scores`, `image_names`, and `image_ids`), sorts them based on the values in `image_scores`, and returns a dictionary with the sorted data.
