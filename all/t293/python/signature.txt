Sure, here is the Python code signature with the same comments:

```python
"""
Reorders image question based on scores in ascending order.

:param image_scores: An array of numerical scores for the images.
:type image_scores: list of float

:param image_names: An array of image names corresponding to the scores.
:type image_names: list of str

:param image_ids: An array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
:type image_ids: list of str or list of int

:return: An object containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
:rtype: dict
"""

def reorder_data(image_scores, image_names, image_ids):
    pass
```

This Python function `reorder_data` has the same parameters and return type as the JavaScript function `reorderData`, along with the provided docstring.
