To convert the JavaScript code signature and comments to Python, we can use Python's docstring format for function documentation. Hereâ€™s how you can write the equivalent Python function signature with the corresponding docstring:
python
def reorder_data(image_scores: list[float], image_names: list[str], image_ids: list[str | float]) -> dict[str, list[float] | list[str]]:
    """
    Reorders image questions based on scores in ascending order.

    Args:
        image_scores (list[float]): An array of numerical scores for the images.
        image_names (list[str]): An array of image names corresponding to the scores.
        image_ids (list[str | float]): An array of image IDs corresponding to the scores.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
            - resultScores (list[float]): A list of sorted numerical scores.
            - resultNames (list[str]): A list of sorted image names.
            - resultIDs (list[str | float]): A list of sorted image IDs.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Signature:
The function is named reorder_data, following Python's snake_case naming convention.
The parameters are annotated with their types:
image_scores: list[float] indicates a list of floating-point numbers for scores.
image_names: list[str] indicates a list of strings for image names.
image_ids: list[str | float] indicates a list that can contain either strings or floating-point numbers for image IDs.
The return type is annotated as dict[str, list[float] | list[str]], indicating a dictionary with string keys and values that are lists of either floats or strings.
Docstring:
The docstring provides a detailed description of the function, similar to JSDoc in JavaScript.
It explains the purpose of the function, the parameters it takes, and what it returns, including types and descriptions for clarity.
Implementation Placeholder:
The pass statement serves as a placeholder where the actual function implementation would go.
This Python function signature and docstring effectively communicate the same information as the original JavaScript documentation.
