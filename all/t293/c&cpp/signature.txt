Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Reorders image question based on scores in ascending order.
 *
 * @param imageScores - A vector of numerical scores for the images.
 * @param imageNames - A vector of image names corresponding to the scores.
 * @param imageIDs - A vector of image IDs corresponding to the scores.
 * @return A struct containing the sorted scores, names, and IDs.
 */
struct ImageReorderResult {
    std::vector<double> resultScores;
    std::vector<std::string> resultNames;
    std::vector<std::variant<std::string, int>> resultIDs; // Using variant to handle both string and integer types
};

ImageReorderResult reorderData(const std::vector<double>& imageScores, const std::vector<std::string>& imageNames, const std::vector<std::variant<std::string, int>>& imageIDs);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `reorderData` takes three parameters: `imageScores`, `imageNames`, and `imageIDs`.
   - It returns an object of type `ImageReorderResult`.

2. **Struct Definition**:
   - `ImageReorderResult` is a struct that contains three members:
     - `resultScores`: A vector of doubles representing the sorted scores.
     - `resultNames`: A vector of strings representing the sorted image names.
     - `resultIDs`: A vector of `std::variant<std::string, int>` which can hold either a string or an integer, representing the sorted image IDs.

3. **Comments**:
   - The comments have been preserved to explain the purpose of the function and its parameters.

This C++ code maintains the functionality and intent of the original JavaScript function while adapting it to C++ syntax and conventions.
