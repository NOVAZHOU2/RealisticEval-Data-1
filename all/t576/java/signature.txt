Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments adapted from your TypeScript version:

```java
/**
 * Hides the sensitive part of a bank account number with 17 numbers, only showing the last 4 characters.
 * For example:
 *      input: 12345678901234567
 *      output: ****4567
 * @param account The bank account number to hide.
 * @return The bank account number with the first part hidden.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException Throws an exception if the account number is not exactly 17 characters long.
 */
public static String hideBankAccount(String account) {
}
