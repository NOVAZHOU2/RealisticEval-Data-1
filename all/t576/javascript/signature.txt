Here's the JavaScript code signature with comments preserved:

```javascript
/**
 * Hides the sensitive part of a bank account number with 17 numbers, only showing the last 4 characters.
 * For example:
 *      input: 12345678901234567
 *      output: ****4567
 * @param {string} account - The bank account number to hide.
 * @returns {string} - The bank account number with the first part hidden.
 * @throws {Error} - Throws an error if the account number is not exactly 17 characters long.
 */
function hideBankAccount(account) {
}
```

This version removes the TypeScript-specific type annotations while keeping the comments intact.
