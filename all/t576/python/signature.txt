To convert the provided TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while preserving the comments, you can use Python's docstring format for documentation. Below is the converted code signature:
python
def hide_bank_account(account: str) -> str:
    """
    Hides the sensitive part of a bank account number with 17 numbers, showing only the last 4 characters.
    
    For example:
        input: 12345678901234567
        output: ****4567

    :param account: The bank account number to hide.
    :return: The bank account number with the first part hidden.
    :raises ValueError: Raises an error if the account number is not exactly 17 characters long.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Name: The function name has been changed from hideBankAccount to hide_bank_account, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations:
account: str specifies that account is expected to be a string.
-> str indicates that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The comment structure is translated into a docstring format, which is the standard in Python for documenting functions.
The docstring includes a description of what the function does, an example of input and output, and details about parameters and return values.
The error type is changed from Error to ValueError to reflect Python's standard for indicating value-related issues.
Implementation Placeholder: The pass statement serves as a placeholder for where the actual implementation of the function would go.
