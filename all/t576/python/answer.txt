Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided TypeScript code into Python. The structure will maintain the same logic, with appropriate changes made to fit Python syntax and conventions.
Converted Python Code
python
def hide_bank_account(account: str) -> str:
    """
    Hides the sensitive part of a bank account number with 17 numbers, showing only the last 4 characters.

    :param account: The bank account number to hide.
    :return: The bank account number with the first part hidden.
    :raises ValueError: Raises an error if the account number is not exactly 17 characters long.
    """
    # Validate that the account number is exactly 17 characters long
    if len(account) != 17:
        raise ValueError("Account number must be exactly 17 characters long.")

    # Create the hidden representation with "****" prefix
    hidden_part = "****"
    
    # Extract the visible part of the account number (last 4 characters)
    visible_part = account[-4:]  # Get last 4 characters
    
    # Return the formatted string with hidden and visible parts
    return hidden_part + visible_part

# Example usage:
# account_number = "12345678901234567"
# print(hide_bank_account(account_number))  # Output: "****4567"
Explanation of the Python Code
Function Definition:
The function is named hide_bank_account and takes one parameter, account, which is expected to be a string.
The return type is specified as str.
Docstring:
A docstring is included to describe the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and exceptions raised, following Python conventions.
Length Validation:
The check for the length of the account number is done using len(account). If the length is not 17, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.
Hidden and Visible Parts:
The hidden part is set as "****".
The visible part is extracted using slicing: account[-4:], which gets the last four characters of the string.
Return Statement:
The function returns the concatenated string of the hidden part and the visible part.
Example Usage:
The commented-out example at the end demonstrates how to use the function and what output to expect. You can uncomment and run the example in a Python environment to see it in action.
