Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments kept intact:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Define a structure to represent each record
struct Record {
    std::string ticker;
    std::string ex_dividend_date;
    double dividend_amount;
};

/**
 * @brief Check for ticker symbols with the same ex-dividend date but different dividend amounts.
 *
 * @param records A vector of Record objects, where each Record contains (ticker, ex_dividend_date, dividend_amount).
 * @return std::vector<Record> A vector of Record objects that have different dividend amounts for the same ex-dividend date.
 */
std::vector<Record> check_dividend_variances(const std::vector<Record>& records);
```

This C++ code defines a `Record` struct to hold the data and a function `check_dividend_variances` that takes a vector of `Record` objects as input and returns a vector of `Record` objects representing those with different dividend amounts for the same ex-dividend date.
