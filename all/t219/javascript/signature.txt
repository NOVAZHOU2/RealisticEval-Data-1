Here's how you can write the JavaScript version of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Check for ticker symbols with the same ex-dividend date but different dividend amounts.
 * @param {Array} records - An array where each element is an object containing properties `ticker`, `exDividendDate`, and `dividendAmount`.
 * @returns {Array} - An array of objects where each object contains properties `ticker` and `exDividendDate` that have different dividend amounts.
 */
function checkDividendVariances(records) {
    
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, we don't have types like in TypeScript or Python. The comments above serve the purpose of documenting what type of data should be passed into the function and what it returns. 

The actual implementation will need to be added within the function body based on your specific requirements.
