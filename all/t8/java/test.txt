Sure, I can help you convert the given Python unittest test class to a Java JUnit test case. However, you haven't provided any specific test cases in your Python code. For the sake of this example, let's assume you have a simple test case that checks if the function `perform_polynomial_decryption` returns the correct result for a given input.

Here's how you might write the equivalent JUnit test case in Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Tester {

    @Test
    public void testPerformPolynomialDecryption() {
        // Arrange
        int degree = 2;
        int modulus = 100;
        int[] key = {5, 3};
        int[] encryptedData = {88, 96};
        
        // Act
        int[] decryptedData = performPolynomialDecryption(degree, modulus, key, encryptedData);
        
        // Assert
        assertEquals(10, decryptedData[0]);
        assertEquals(8, decryptedData[1]);
    }
    
    // Assuming performPolynomialDecryption method is implemented here or imported from another package
    private int[] performPolynomialDecryption(int degree, int modulus, int[] key, int[] encryptedData) {
        // Implementation goes here
        // For demonstration purposes, let's assume it returns a dummy decrypted data
        return new int[]{10, 8};
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The package declaration is `org.real.temp`, which matches the package you specified.
2. **Class Declaration**: The class name is `Tester`.
3. **JUnit Test Method**: The `testPerformPolynomialDecryption` method is annotated with `@Test`, indicating that it is a JUnit test method.
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**:
   - **Arrange**: Set up the inputs for the test, such as `degree`, `modulus`, `key`, and `encryptedData`.
   - **Act**: Call the method under test (`performPolynomialDecryption`) with the arranged inputs.
   - **Assert**: Use assertions to verify that the output of the method is as expected. In this example, we use `assertEquals` to check if the first element of the decrypted data is `10` and the second element is `8`.

### Note:
- The `performPolynomialDecryption` method is assumed to be implemented elsewhere or imported from another package. If it's not implemented here, you need to provide an actual implementation or mock it using frameworks like Mockito.
- Ensure that the method signature and logic match what you expect from the Python function.
