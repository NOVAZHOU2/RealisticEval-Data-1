Here's the C++ equivalent of your Python code signature with comments converted to C++ style documentation:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * @brief Implement decryption based on polynomials and keys.
 * 
 * @param degree The highest degree of a polynomial is added by one.
 * @param modulus Modulus to use when encrypting question.
 * @param key An array of encrypted keys.
 * @param encrypted_data An array of encrypted question.
 * @return std::vector<int> Decrypted question.
 */
std::vector<int> perform_polynomial_decryption(int degree, int modulus, const std::vector<int>& key, const std::vector<int>& encrypted_data);
``` 

This keeps the functionality and intent of the original code while adapting it to C++.
