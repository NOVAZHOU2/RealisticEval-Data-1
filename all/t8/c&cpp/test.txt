To convert your Python `unittest` test case into a C++ test case using Catch2, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Catch2.
2. Write the equivalent C++ test cases.

Here's an example of how you might write a C++ test case for the given Python function using Catch2:

### Step 1: Install Catch2
If you haven't already installed Catch2, you can do so via vcpkg or manually download it. For simplicity, let's assume you've downloaded it manually and placed it in your project directory.

### Step 2: Write the C++ Test Case

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <vector>

// Assuming the function is defined in a file named "polynomial.cpp"
extern std::vector<int> perform_polynomial_decryption(int degree, int modulus, const std::vector<int>& key, const std::vector<int>& encrypted_data);

TEST_CASE("Polynomial Decryption", "[decryption]") {
    // Test case 1
    int degree1 = 3;
    int modulus1 = 7;
    std::vector<int> key1 = {1, 2, 3};
    std::vector<int> encrypted_data1 = {4, 5, 6};
    std::vector<int> expected_result1 = {0, 0, 0}; // Expected result based on the function logic

    REQUIRE(perform_polynomial_decryption(degree1, modulus1, key1, encrypted_data1) == expected_result1);

    // Test case 2
    int degree2 = 2;
    int modulus2 = 11;
    std::vector<int> key2 = {3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> encrypted_data2 = {7, 8, 9};
    std::vector<int> expected_result2 = {0, 0, 0}; // Expected result based on the function logic

    REQUIRE(perform_polynomial_decryption(degree2, modulus2, key2, encrypted_data2) == expected_result2);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: Include the Catch2 header at the top of your file.
2. **Function Prototype**: Ensure that the function prototype for `perform_polynomial_decryption` is available in your project. This could be in a separate `.cpp` file that you link against.
3. **Test Cases**: Use the `TEST_CASE` macro to define individual test cases. Each test case should include input parameters and the expected output.
4. **Assertions**: Use the `REQUIRE` macro to assert that the actual result matches the expected result.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, you'll need to compile your code with the Catch2 library linked. Here's an example using g++:

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -I/path/to/catch2/single_include -o test_polynomial test_polynomial.cpp polynomial.cpp
./test_polynomial
```

Replace `/path/to/catch2/single_include` with the actual path where you have the Catch2 headers.

This will compile and run your test cases using Catch2. If any assertions fail, Catch2 will provide detailed information about which test case failed and why.
