Sure, here's the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function performPolynomialDecryption(
  degree: number,
  modulus: number,
  key: number[],
  encryptedData: number[]
): number[] {
  // Implementation of polynomial decryption goes here
  return []; // Placeholder return value
}
```

In TypeScript, we don't have type hints in the same way as Python, so we use `number` for integers and `Array<number>` for lists. The function signature is defined using the `function` keyword, and the return type is specified after the arrow `=>`. 

Please note that you need to implement the actual logic inside the function according to your requirements.
