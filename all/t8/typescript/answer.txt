Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function performPolynomialDecryption(degree: number, modulus: number, key: number[], encryptedData: number[]): number[] {
    /**
     * Implement decryption based on polynomials and keys
     * @param degree - The highest degree of a polynomial is added by one
     * @param modulus - Modulus to use when encrypting question
     * @param key - An array of encrypted keys
     * @param encryptedData - An array of encrypted question
     * @returns decrypted question
     */

    // Your decryption logic goes here.
    const decryptedData: number[] = []; // Replace with actual decryption logic

    return decryptedData;
}
```

This TypeScript function follows the same structure as your Python code, including the parameters and return type. You can fill in the decryption logic as needed.
