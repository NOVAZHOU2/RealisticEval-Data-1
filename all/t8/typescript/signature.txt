Here's the TypeScript code signature based on the provided Python code, including the comments converted to TypeScript style documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Implement decryption based on polynomials and keys
 * @param degree - The highest degree of a polynomial is added by one
 * @param modulus - Modulus to use when encrypting question
 * @param key - An array of encrypted keys
 * @param encryptedData - An array of encrypted question
 * @returns Decrypted question
 */
function performPolynomialDecryption(degree: number, modulus: number, key: number[], encryptedData: number[]): number[] {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

Feel free to add the implementation inside the function as needed!
