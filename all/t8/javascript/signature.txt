Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code signature with comments converted to JavaScript style:

```javascript
/**
 * Implement decryption based on polynomials and keys
 * @param {number} degree - The highest degree of a polynomial is added by one
 * @param {number} modulus - Modulus to use when encrypting question
 * @param {number[]} key - An array of encrypted keys
 * @param {number[]} encrypted_data - An array of encrypted question
 * @returns {number[]} decrypted question
 */
function performPolynomialDecryption(degree, modulus, key, encrypted_data) {
    // Your decryption logic here
}
```
