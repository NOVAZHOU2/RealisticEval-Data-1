Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java method signature for the provided Python function:

```java
/**
 * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
 *
 * @param filename     The name of the file to write to.
 * @param lineContent  The content of the line to write.
 */
public static void writeUniqueLineToFile(String filename, String lineContent) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the functionality and documentation of the original Python function.
