Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. This Java code maintains the functionality of checking if a line already exists in a file before appending it:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
     *
     * @param filename    The name of the file to write to.
     * @param lineContent The content of the line to write.
     */
    public static void writeUniqueLineToFile(String filename, String lineContent) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
            String currentLine;
            while ((currentLine = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                if (currentLine.equals(lineContent)) {
                    System.out.println("Line '" + lineContent + "' already exists in '" + filename + "'. Not writing again.");
                    return;
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filename, true))) {
            writer.write(lineContent);
            writer.newLine();
            System.out.println("Line '" + lineContent + "' successfully written to '" + filename + "'.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error writing to the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        writeUniqueLineToFile("example.txt", "This is a test line.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **BufferedReader and BufferedWriter**: These classes are used to read from and write to files efficiently.
2. **Try-with-resources Statement**: This ensures that resources (`BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`) are automatically closed after use.
3. **IOException Handling**: Proper exception handling is included to manage errors during file operations.
4. **Method Signature**: The method `writeUniqueLineToFile` is defined as `static` because it doesn't depend on any instance variables.

This Java code closely mirrors the functionality of the original Python code, ensuring that lines are only appended to the file if they do not already exist.
