Here is the equivalent C++ function signature based on your Python code:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
 *
 * @param filename The name of the file to write to.
 * @param lineContent The content of the line to write.
 */
void writeUniqueLineToFile(const std::string& filename, const std::string& lineContent);
```

This C++ function has the same purpose and parameters as your Python function. It's designed to be used in a C++ project where you want to ensure that each line written to a file is unique.
