Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function, including the documentation comments using JSDoc style:

```typescript
/**
 * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
 *
 * @param filename - The name of the file to write to.
 * @param lineContent - The content of the line to write.
 */
function writeUniqueLineToFile(filename: string, lineContent: string): void {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note: The actual implementation logic would need to be added inside the function body according to the requirements described in the docstring. Since the implementation details were not provided, I have left it as a placeholder comment.
