Here is your Python function converted to TypeScript with the corresponding comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The name of the file to write to.
 * @param {string} lineContent - The content of the line to write.
 * @returns {void}
 */
async function writeUniqueLineToFile(filename: string, lineContent: string): Promise<void> {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in TypeScript, we use `Promise<void>` for functions that don't return any value but may perform asynchronous operations. If your original Python function performs any I/O operations like reading or writing files, you would need to convert those into their equivalent async/await syntax in TypeScript.
