Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python function:

```javascript
function writeUniqueLineToFile(filename, lineContent) {
    /*
     * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
     *
     * @param {string} filename - The name of the file to write to.
     * @param {string} lineContent - The content of the line to write.
     */

    // Read existing lines from file
    let fs = require('fs');
    let data = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');

    // Split data into an array of lines
    let lines = data.split('\n');

    // Check if the line already exists in the file
    if (!lines.includes(lineContent)) {
        // If it doesn't, append the new line to the file
        fs.appendFileSync(filename, '\n' + lineContent);
    }
}
```

This JavaScript function uses Node.js's built-in `fs` module to read and write files. It reads all lines from the specified file, checks if the given line content already exists among them, and appends the new line if it doesn't. Note that this approach works well for small to medium-sized files but may be inefficient for very large files due to loading the entire file content into memory. For larger files, you might want to consider processing the file line-by-line or using more advanced techniques.
