Here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Writes a line to a text file only if the line with the same content does not already exist.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The name of the file to write to.
 * @param {string} lineContent - The content of the line to write.
 */
function writeUniqueLineToFile(filename, lineContent) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note that in JavaScript, function parameters do not include type annotations by default, but JSDoc comments are used instead to specify the types and descriptions of the parameters. Also, since the Python function does not return any value (`None`), the JavaScript function also does not return any value, which is indicated by the absence of a `Returns` tag in the JSDoc comment. 

The function name has been changed to `writeUniqueLineToFile` to follow the camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript.
