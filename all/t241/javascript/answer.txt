Here is the JavaScript version of your Python code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function getMinSeqNumAndDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    let minLine = null;
    let minDistance = Infinity;

    const lines = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8').split('\n');
    for(let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
        const words = lines[i].split(/\s+/);
        let index1 = -1;
        let index2 = -1;
        words.forEach((word, j) => {
            if(word === word1) index1 = j;
            if(word === word2) index2 = j;
        });
        if(index1 !== -1 && index2 !== -1) {
            const distance = Math.abs(index1 - index2);
            if(distance < minDistance) {
                minDistance = distance;
                minLine = i + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return [minLine, minDistance];
}
```

This function reads the content of the file synchronously using `fs.readFileSync`, splits it into lines, then for each line it further splits it into words. It checks for the presence of `word1` and `word2` in the current line and calculates their indices. If both words are present, it calculates the absolute difference between their indices which gives us the distance. If this distance is less than the previously recorded minimum distance, it updates the minimum distance and line number. 

Please note that in JavaScript, array indices start at 0, so we add 1 to `i` to get the line number starting from 1. Also, JavaScript uses `Infinity` instead of `float('inf')`.
