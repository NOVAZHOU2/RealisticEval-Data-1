Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the minimum distance between two words in a text file, considering each line as a separate sequence.
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file to read.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns {Array} An array containing the line number with the minimum distance and the minimum distance itself.
 *                  Returns [null, Infinity] if one or both words are not found in any line.
 */
function getMinSeqNumAndDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    let minSeqNum = null;
    let currentLineNumber = 0;

    try {
        const fs = require('fs');
        const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
        const lines = fileContent.split('\n');

        for (let line of lines) {
            const words = line.trim().split(/\s+/);
            const word1Indices = [];
            const word2Indices = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                if (words[i] === word1) {
                    word1Indices.push(i);
                }
                if (words[i] === word2) {
                    word2Indices.push(i);
                }
            }

            for (let index1 of word1Indices) {
                for (let index2 of word2Indices) {
                    const distance = Math.abs(index1 - index2);
                    if (distance < minDistance) {
                        minDistance = distance;
                        minSeqNum = currentLineNumber;
                    }
                }
            }

            currentLineNumber += 1;
        }

    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            console.log(`Error: The file ${filePath} does not exist.`);
            return [null, Infinity];
        } else {
            console.log(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);
            return [null, Infinity];
        }
    }

    return [minSeqNum, minDistance];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function signature is rewritten to use the `function` keyword.
   - The parameter names and types are documented using JSDoc comments.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The function documentation is rewritten using JSDoc format.
   - The `@param` tags describe the parameters.
   - The `@returns` tag describes the return value.

3. **File Reading**:
   - The `fs` module is used to read the file synchronously using `fs.readFileSync`.
   - The file content is split into lines using `split('\n')`.

4. **Word Indexing**:
   - For each line, the words are split and their indices are collected for `word1` and `word2`.

5. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distances between the indices of `word1` and `word2` are calculated and the minimum distance is updated accordingly.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - File not found and other errors are caught and handled appropriately.

This JavaScript function should provide the same functionality as the original Python code, with proper documentation using JSDoc.
