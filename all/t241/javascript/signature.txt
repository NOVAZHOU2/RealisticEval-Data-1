Sure! Here's the JavaScript version of your Python function, keeping the same structure and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the minimum distance between two words in a text file, considering each line as a separate sequence.
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file to read.
 * @param {string} word1 - The first word to search for.
 * @param {string} word2 - The second word to search for.
 * @returns {Array} An array containing the line number with the minimum distance and the minimum distance itself.
 *                  Returns [null, Infinity] if one or both words are not found in any line.
 */
function getMinSeqNumAndDistance(filePath, word1, word2) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This JavaScript function has the same parameters and return type as your original Python function, with the appropriate JSDoc comments for documentation. You can fill in the implementation details within the `getMinSeqNumAndDistance` function body.
