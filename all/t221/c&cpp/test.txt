To convert your Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2, you need to define a test fixture in C++. Below is an example of how you can do this. This assumes that `extract_parse_dicts` function is already implemented and available for testing.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed. If not, you can install it via vcpkg or manually download it from [Catch2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Here's how you can write the equivalent C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

// Assuming this function is defined somewhere in your project
std::vector<std::map<std::string, std::string>> extract_parse_dicts(const std::string& file_path);

TEST_CASE("Extract and Parse Dictionaries", "[file parsing]") {
    // Create a temporary file with some dictionary-like content
    std::ofstream tempFile;
    tempFile.open("temp_dict_file.txt");
    tempFile << "{ \"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\" }\n";
    tempFile << "{ \"key3\": \"value3\", \"key4\": \"value4\" }\n";
    tempFile.close();

    // Call the function under test
    auto result = extract_parse_dicts("temp_dict_file.txt");

    // Check if the result contains the correct number of dictionaries
    REQUIRE(result.size() == 2);

    // Check if each dictionary is correctly parsed
    CHECK(result[0]["key1"] == "value1");
    CHECK(result[0]["key2"] == "value2");
    CHECK(result[1]["key3"] == "value3");
    CHECK(result[1]["key4"] == "value4");

    // Clean up the temporary file
    std::remove("temp_dict_file.txt");
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` line includes the Catch2 header file, which is necessary for writing tests in Catch2.

2. **Temporary File Creation**: In the test case, a temporary file named `temp_dict_file.txt` is created and populated with some dictionary-like content. This is done to simulate the input file for the `extract_parse_dicts` function.

3. **Function Call**: The `extract_parse_dicts` function is called with the path to the temporary file.

4. **Assertions**:
   - `REQUIRE(result.size() == 2);`: Ensures that the function returns the expected number of dictionaries.
   - `CHECK(result[0]["key1"] == "value1");`: Checks if the first dictionary contains the correct key-value pairs.
   - `CHECK(result[1]["key3"] == "value3");`: Checks if the second dictionary contains the correct key-value pairs.

5. **Cleanup**: After the test, the temporary file is removed to clean up.

This should give you a good starting point for converting your Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2. Adjust the file handling and dictionary parsing logic according to your specific requirements.
