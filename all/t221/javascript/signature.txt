Sure! Here is the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts and parses strings containing JavaScript object syntax from a given file.
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file from which to extract object strings.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - A list of objects extracted and parsed from the file.
 */
function extractParseObjects(filePath) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, there's no direct equivalent to Python's type hints (`typing` module), so I've removed those. If you need to enforce types in JavaScript, consider using libraries like `io-ts`, `typescript`, or runtime checks.
