Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts and parses strings containing JSON-like dictionary syntax from a given file.
 * 
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file from which to extract dictionary strings.
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} A promise that resolves to an array of dictionaries extracted and parsed from the file.
 */
async function extractParseDicts(filePath) {
    // This regex pattern is designed to match simple dictionary structures
    const dictPattern = /\{[^\{]*?\}/g;
    const extractedDicts = [];

    const fs = require('fs').promises;

    try {
        const fileContents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
        const matches = fileContents.match(dictPattern);

        if (matches) {
            for (const match of matches) {
                try {
                    // Use JSON.parse to safely parse the string that looks like a dictionary
                    const parsedDict = JSON.parse(match);
                    extractedDicts.push(parsedDict);
                } catch (error) {
                    // Handle the case where the string is not a valid JSON dictionary
                    console.log(`Skipping invalid dictionary: ${match}`);
                }
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error reading file: ${filePath}`, error);
    }

    return extractedDicts;
}

// Example usage:
(async () => {
    const filePath = './example.txt'; // Replace with your file path
    const result = await extractParseDicts(filePath);
    console.log(result);
})();
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `extract_parse_dicts` is renamed to `extractParseDicts` to follow camelCase naming convention in JavaScript.
   - The type annotations are removed since JavaScript does not have built-in type annotations, but the JSDoc comments provide the necessary type information.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The Python docstring is converted to JSDoc comments for better integration with JavaScript documentation tools.
   - The `@param` and `@returns` tags are used to document the parameters and return types.

3. **File Reading**:
   - The `fs.promises.readFile` method is used to read the file asynchronously.
   - The `await` keyword is used to wait for the asynchronous operation to complete.

4. **Regex Pattern**:
   - The regex pattern remains the same but is adjusted to work with JavaScript's string matching capabilities.

5. **Parsing**:
   - `JSON.parse` is used to safely parse the dictionary strings.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is done using `try...catch` blocks to handle any exceptions that may occur during file reading or parsing.

7. **Example Usage**:
   - An example usage block is provided to demonstrate how to call the function asynchronously.

This conversion ensures that the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code are preserved in JavaScript, with appropriate documentation using JSDoc.
