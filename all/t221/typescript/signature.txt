Here is your Python code translated into TypeScript with type annotations:

```typescript
/**
 * Extract and parse strings containing Python dictionary syntax from a given file.
 * 
 * @param {string} file_path - The path to the file from which to extract dictionary strings.
 * @returns {Object[]} A list of dictionaries extracted and parsed from the file.
 */
function extractParseDictionaries(file_path: string): Object[] {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, `Object` is used instead of `Dict`, and `List` is replaced with `Array`. Also, the `->` syntax in Python is replaced with `:` in TypeScript for specifying function return types.
