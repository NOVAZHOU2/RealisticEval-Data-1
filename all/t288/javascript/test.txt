Certainly! Below is the equivalent Jest test suite for the given Python unittest class. The goal is to maintain the same functionality and logic while adapting to Jest's syntax and conventions.

### Python Unittest Code

```python
import unittest

class TestBresenhamLineAlgorithm(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_horizontal_line(self):
        """Test a horizontal line from left to right."""
        result = bresenham_line(1, 5, 10, 5)
        expected = [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (10, 5)]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_vertical_line(self):
        """Test a vertical line from top to bottom."""
        result = bresenham_line(7, 2, 7, 10)
        expected = [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10)]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_diagonal_line(self):
        """Test a diagonal line."""
        result = bresenham_line(0, 0, 5, 5)
        expected = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_negative_slope_line(self):
        """Test a line with a negative slope."""
        result = bresenham_line(6, 8, 1, 3)
        expected = [(6, 8), (5, 7), (4, 6), (3, 5), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_steep_slope_line(self):
        """Test a line that is steeper than it is wide."""
        result = bresenham_line(2, 2, 3, 7)
        expected = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

### Equivalent Jest Test Suite

```javascript
const bresenhamLine = require('./bresenhamLine'); // Import the bresenhamLine function

describe('Bresenham Line Algorithm', () => {
    it('should generate a horizontal line from left to right', () => {
        const result = bresenhamLine(1, 5, 10, 5);
        const expected = [[1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5], [7, 5], [8, 5], [9, 5], [10, 5]];
        expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should generate a vertical line from top to bottom', () => {
        const result = bresenhamLine(7, 2, 7, 10);
        const expected = [[7, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4], [7, 5], [7, 6], [7, 7], [7, 8], [7, 9], [7, 10]];
        expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should generate a diagonal line', () => {
        const result = bresenhamLine(0, 0, 5, 5);
        const expected = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4], [5, 5]];
        expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should generate a line with a negative slope', () => {
        const result = bresenhamLine(6, 8, 1, 3);
        const expected = [[6, 8], [5, 7], [4, 6], [3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 3]];
        expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should generate a line that is steeper than it is wide', () => {
        const result = bresenhamLine(2, 2, 3, 7);
        const expected = [[2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]];
        expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Statement**: The `bresenhamLine` function is imported at the beginning of the test file.
2. **Describe Block**: The `describe` block is used to group the tests under a descriptive title.
3. **It Blocks**: Each `it` block represents a specific test case.
4. **Assertions**: The `expect` function is used to assert the equality of the results with the expected values using `toEqual`.

### Key Differences:
- **Data Types**: In Python, tuples are used for points, while in JavaScript, arrays are used.
- **Assertion Function**: In Python, `self.assertEqual` is used, while in JavaScript, `expect` with `toEqual` is used for deep equality checks.

This conversion ensures that the functionality and logic of the tests are preserved while adapting to Jest's syntax and conventions.
