Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Use Bresenham line algorithm to generate a straight line between two points,
 * returning all the points that the line passes through.
 *
 * @param {number} x1 - The x-coordinate of the start point.
 * @param {number} y1 - The y-coordinate of the start point.
 * @param {number} x2 - The x-coordinate of the end point.
 * @param {number} y2 - The y-coordinate of the end point.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} A list of points (arrays of x and y coordinates)
 * that the line passes through.
 */
function bresenhamLine(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
```

This JavaScript function signature maintains the same structure and documentation as the original Python function. It uses JSDoc style comments for documentation, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects.
