Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Use Bresenham's line algorithm to generate a straight line between two points,
 * returning all the points that the line passes through.
 * 
 * @param x1 - The x coordinate of the start point.
 * @param y1 - The y coordinate of the start point.
 * @param x2 - The x coordinate of the end point.
 * @param y2 - The y coordinate of the end point.
 * @returns An array of points (tuples of x and y coordinates) that the line passes through.
 */
function bresenhamLine(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number): [number, number][] {
    // Implementation of the Bresenham's line algorithm would go here.
    // This function should return an array of tuples representing the points on the line.
}
```

In this TypeScript version, the function signature `bresenhamLine` has been defined with parameters typed as `number`, and the return type is specified as an array of tuples `[number, number][]`. The docstring has been converted to a JSDoc-style comment block.
