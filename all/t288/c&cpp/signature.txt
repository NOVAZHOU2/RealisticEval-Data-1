Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility> // For std::pair

/**
 * Use Bresenham's line algorithm to generate a straight line between two points,
 * returning all the points that the line passes through.
 *
 * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the start point.
 * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the start point.
 * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the end point.
 * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the end point.
 *
 * @return A vector of pairs representing the points (x and y coordinates) that the line passes through.
 */
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> bresenham_line(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note that `List[Tuple[int, int]]` in Python is translated to `std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>` in C++. Also, the docstring has been converted into a multi-line comment block following C++ conventions.
