Sure, here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert a dictionary of lists into a list of dictionaries.
 * @param {Object} dictOfLists - A dictionary where each key has a list as its value.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - A list where each item is a dictionary formed by corresponding elements of lists in the input dictionary.
 */
function dictOfListsToListOfDicts(dictOfLists) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript version maintains the same functionality and documentation style as the original Python function.
