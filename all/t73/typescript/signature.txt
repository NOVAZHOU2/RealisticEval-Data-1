Sure! Here's the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert a dictionary of lists into a list of dictionaries.
 * @param dictOfLists - A dictionary where each key has a list as its value.
 * @returns A list where each item is a dictionary formed by corresponding elements of lists in the input dictionary.
 */
function dictOfListsToListOfDicts(dictOfLists: { [key: string]: any[] }): { [key: string]: any }[] {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The `dictOfLists` parameter is typed as an object (`{ [key: string]: any[] }`) which means it can have keys of type `string` and values that are arrays of any type.
- The return type is also an array of objects (`{ [key: string]: any }[]`).
