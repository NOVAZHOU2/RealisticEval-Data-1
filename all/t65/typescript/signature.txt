Here is your Python code translated into TypeScript with type annotations and comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Find duplicate IPs in the given IP list excluding specified IPs to ignore.
 *
 * @param ipList - List of IP addresses
 * @param ignoreList - List of IP addresses to ignore
 * @returns A list of duplicate IPs excluding those in the ignore list.
 */
function findDuplicateIps(ipList: string[], ignoreList: string[]): string[] {
    
}
```

Please note that in TypeScript you don't have to explicitly declare return types for functions because they can be inferred from the function body, but it's still good practice to do so.
