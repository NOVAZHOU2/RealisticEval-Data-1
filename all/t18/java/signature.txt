Sure! Below is the equivalent Java method signature with comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts a floating-point number between 0 and 1 to an RGB color ranging from red to green.
 *
 * @param value The floating-point number between 0 and 1.
 * @return A tuple representing the RGB color.
 */
public static int[] floatToRGB(float value) {
```

In Java, we typically return an array or use other data structures like `Tuple` from libraries such as Apache Commons Lang if you need to return multiple values. Here's an example using an array:

```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.ImmutablePair;

/**
 * Converts a floating-point number between 0 and 1 to an RGB color ranging from red to green.
 *
 * @param value The floating-point number between 0 and 1.
 * @return An ImmutablePair representing the RGB color.
 */
public static ImmutablePair<Integer, Integer> floatToRGB(float value) {
```

If you prefer not to use external libraries, you can simply return an array of integers:

```java
/**
 * Converts a floating-point number between 0 and 1 to an RGB color ranging from red to green.
 *
 * @param value The floating-point number between 0 and 1.
 * @return An array of integers representing the RGB color.
 */
public static int[] floatToRGB(float value) {
```
