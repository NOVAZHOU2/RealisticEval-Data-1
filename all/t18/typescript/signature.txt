Sure, here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert a floating point number between 0 and 1 to a color from red to green in the color format RGB
 * @param value - A float between 0 and 1.
 * @returns A tuple representing the RGB color.
 */
function floatToRgb(value: number): [number, number, number] {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function `floatToRgb` takes a single argument `value` of type `number` and returns a tuple of three numbers representing an RGB color. The comments describe the purpose of the function and its parameters.
