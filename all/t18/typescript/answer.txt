Here is how you can translate your Python function to TypeScript:

```typescript
function floatToRGB(value: number): [number, number, number] {
    /**
     * Convert a floating point number between 0 and 1 to a color from red to green in the color format RGB
     * @param value - A float between 0 and 1.
     * 
     * @returns A tuple representing the RGB color.
     */
    
    if (value < 0 || value > 1) {
        throw new Error("Value must be between 0 and 1");
    }

    let r = Math.round(255 * value);
    let g = Math.round(255 * (1 - value));
    let b = 0;

    return [r, g, b];
}
```

In this code, I've translated the Python function into a TypeScript function with the same functionality. It takes a floating point number between 0 and 1 as an argument and returns a tuple representing the RGB color. If the input value is not within the range of 0 to 1, it throws an error. The `Math.round` method rounds the calculated values to the nearest whole numbers before returning them.
