Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided Python function:

```java
/**
 * Extracts the contents of the outermost brackets from the input string.
 * For example:
 *     input: Text [with [nested] brackets] and more text
 *     output: with [nested] brackets
 *
 * @param s The input string containing brackets.
 * @return The contents within the outermost brackets, or an empty string if no brackets are found.
 */
public String extractOutermostBrackets(String s);
```

This Java method signature includes the necessary Javadoc comments that describe the purpose of the method, its parameters, and its return value.
