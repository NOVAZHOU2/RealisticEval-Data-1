Certainly! Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function, including proper type annotations and JSDoc-style documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts the contents of the outermost brackets from the input string.
 * 
 * Example:
 *   Input: "Text [with [nested] brackets] and more text"
 *   Output: "with [nested] brackets"
 * 
 * @param s - The input string containing brackets.
 * @returns The contents within the outermost brackets, or an empty string if no brackets are found.
 */
function extractOutermostBrackets(s: string): string {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    let startIndex = -1;
    const openingBrackets = "({[";
    const closingBrackets = ")}]";
    const matchingBracket: { [key: string]: string } = { ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[' };

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (openingBrackets.includes(char)) {  // Check for any opening bracket
            if (stack.length === 0) {  // If the stack is empty, we have found the outermost opening bracket
                startIndex = i;  // Remember the position of the first opening bracket
            }
            stack.push(char);
        } else if (closingBrackets.includes(char)) {  // Check for any closing bracket
            if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === matchingBracket[char]) {  // Match with the latest opening bracket
                stack.pop();
                if (stack.length === 0) {  // When stack is empty, we found the outermost closing bracket
                    return s.substring(startIndex + 1, i);  // Extract contents between the brackets
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return "";  // Return an empty string if no outermost brackets were found
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `extractOutermostBrackets` is defined with a single parameter `s` of type `string` and returns a `string`.
2. **JSDoc Documentation**: The JSDoc-style documentation is added to describe the function, its parameters, and its return value.
3. **Stack Initialization**: A stack is initialized as an array `stack`.
4. **Start Index**: A variable `startIndex` is used to keep track of the starting index of the outermost opening bracket.
5. **Opening and Closing Brackets**: The strings `openingBrackets` and `closingBrackets` contain the characters representing opening and closing brackets respectively.
6. **Matching Bracket Map**: An object `matchingBracket` maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
7. **Loop Through String**: The function iterates through the input string using a `for` loop.
   - For each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket and updates the `startIndex` accordingly.
   - If it is a closing bracket, it checks if it matches the latest opening bracket in the stack.
8. **Return Result**: If the stack becomes empty after finding a matching pair, the content between the brackets is extracted and returned.
9. **Default Return**: If no outermost brackets are found, an empty string is returned.

This TypeScript code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code while adhering to TypeScript's static type system and documentation standards.
