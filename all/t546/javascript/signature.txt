Sure! Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads tab-separated values (TSV) from standard input and returns a list of rows.
 *
 * Each row is represented as an array of strings. If rows have unequal lengths,
 * they are padded with empty strings to ensure all rows have the same length.
 *
 * @returns {Array<Array<string>>} - A list of arrays, where each inner array represents a row of data.
 */
function readTsvFromStdin() {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc-style comments to document functions. The `@returns` tag specifies the return type of the function, and the comment inside the docstring provides a description of what the function does.
