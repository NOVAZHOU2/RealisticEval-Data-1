Here's how you can translate the Python function signature into Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    /**
     * Reads tab-separated values (TSV) from standard input and returns a list of rows.
     *
     * Each row is represented as a list of strings. If rows have unequal lengths,
     * they are padded with empty strings to ensure all rows have the same length.
     *
     * @return List<List<String>>: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of data.
     */
    public static List<List<String>> readTsvFromStdin() {
        // Implementation goes here...
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        List<List<String>> rows = readTsvFromStdin();
        for (List<String> row : rows) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row.toArray()));
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code includes a method `readTsvFromStdin` that matches the functionality described in your Python code. The method reads TSV data from standard input and returns a list of rows, where each row is a list of strings. Note that the actual implementation of reading from standard input is not provided here; you would need to add that part based on your specific requirements.
