To convert the provided TypeScript function signature to Python while keeping the comments intact, you can utilize Python's type hinting feature. Hereâ€™s how you can represent the same functionality in Python:
python
from typing import List, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

def compare_arrays(arr1: List[T], arr2: List[T]) -> bool:
    """
    Compares two arrays to determine if they contain the same unique elements, irrespective of order.

    :param arr1: The first array to compare. Elements can be of any type T.
    :param arr2: The second array to compare. Elements should be of the same type as the first array.
    :returns: Returns true if both arrays contain the same unique elements, otherwise returns false.

    :template T: The type of the elements in the arrays.
    """
    # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
TypeVar: We use TypeVar to create a generic type variable T, allowing the function to accept lists of any type.
List: The List type from the typing module specifies that arr1 and arr2 are lists containing elements of type T.
Function Signature: The function name is converted to snake_case, which is the conventional naming style in Python.
Docstring: The comments are retained in the form of a docstring, which is standard for documenting Python functions.
This Python function can now be implemented with the appropriate logic to compare the two lists for unique elements.
