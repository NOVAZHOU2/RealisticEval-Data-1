Sure! Here is the equivalent Python function that calculates the average of an array of numbers:

```python
def get_array_average(array):
    """
    Calculate the average of an array of numbers.

    :param array: An array of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
    :type array: list of float or int
    :return: The average (mean) of the array's elements, or None if the array is empty.
    :rtype: float or None
    """
    if not array:
        return None
    
    total = sum(array)
    count = len(array)
    
    return total / count
```

This Python function `get_array_average` takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average. If the list is empty, it returns `None`.
