To convert the given JavaScript function getArrayAverage to Python, we need to follow a similar structure while adhering to Python's syntax. Below is the JavaScript code you provided, followed by its Python equivalent.
Original JavaScript Code
javascript
function getArrayAverage(array) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum / array.length;
}
Converted Python Code
Here’s how the same function can be implemented in Python:
python
def get_array_average(array):
    sum_ = 0
    for i in range(len(array)):
        sum_ += array[i]
    return sum_ / len(array) if array else 0  # Avoid division by zero
Breakdown of the Python Code
Function Definition:
The function is defined using the def keyword in Python. The name follows the snake_case convention, resulting in get_array_average.
Variable Initialization:
sum_ is initialized to 0. We use an underscore (_) to avoid conflict with the built-in sum() function in Python.
Looping Through the Array:
We use range(len(array)) to iterate through the indices of the list (array). The loop structure is similar, but in Python, we typically use for item in array: instead of indexing, which is more Pythonic.
Calculating the Average:
The average is calculated by dividing sum_ by the length of the array (len(array)).
We include a check to ensure that if the array is empty, it returns 0 to avoid a division by zero error.
More Pythonic Version
For a more Pythonic implementation, you can use the built-in sum() function and take advantage of the fact that you can directly iterate through the list without needing to manage indices:
python
def get_array_average(array):
    if not array:  # Check if the array is empty
        return 0
    return sum(array) / len(array)
Example Usage
Here’s how you would use the function in practice:
python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = get_array_average(numbers)
print(f"The average is: {average}")
This would output:
The average is: 3.0
This Python code effectively replicates the behavior of the original JavaScript function, while utilizing Python's features and idioms.
