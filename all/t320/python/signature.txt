To convert the given JavaScript code signature and its documentation comment into a Python code signature, we will use Python's docstring format for documentation. Below is how you would write the equivalent function signature in Python.
Original JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * calculate the average of an array of numbers
 *
 * @param {number[]} array - An array of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
 * @returns {number} - The average (mean) of the array's elements, or NaN if the array is empty.
 */
function getArrayAverage(array) {}
Converted Python Code Signature
In Python, the equivalent function signature with a docstring would look like this:
python
def get_array_average(array):
    """
    Calculate the average of an array of numbers.

    :param array: A list of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
    :type array: list[float]
    :returns: The average (mean) of the array's elements, or float('nan') if the array is empty.
    :rtype: float
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function body
Breakdown of the Python Code Signature
Function Definition:
The function is defined with def followed by the function name get_array_average. The name is in snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
Docstring:
The docstring is enclosed in triple quotes ("""). It provides a description of what the function does.
The first line summarizes the function's purpose.
The :param tag describes the input parameter and its type.
The :returns tag describes the output of the function.
The :type and :rtype tags specify the expected types of the input parameter and the return value, respectively.
Function Body:
The function body currently contains a pass statement, indicating that it is a placeholder and does not implement any functionality yet.
Example Usage
Here's how you might implement and call the function later:
python
import math

def get_array_average(array):
    """
    Calculate the average of an array of numbers.

    :param array: A list of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
    :type array: list[float]
    :returns: The average (mean) of the array's elements, or float('nan') if the array is empty.
    :rtype: float
    """
    if not array:  # Check if the array is empty
        return float('nan')
    return sum(array) / len(array)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = get_array_average(numbers)
print(f"The average is: {average}")
This complete Python implementation provides a proper signature with a docstring and a functional body that calculates the average of an array of numbers, similar to the intent of the original JavaScript function.
