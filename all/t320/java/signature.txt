Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the average of an array of numbers.
 *
 * @param array An array of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
 * @return The average (mean) of the array's elements, or NaN if the array is empty.
 */
public double getArrayAverage(int[] array) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Please note that in Java, arrays are passed by reference, so there's no need to specify the type of the parameter in the method signature. Additionally, Java uses `double` instead of `number` for floating-point numbers, and it doesn't have a direct equivalent to JavaScript's `NaN`, but you can return `Double.NaN` if the array is empty.
