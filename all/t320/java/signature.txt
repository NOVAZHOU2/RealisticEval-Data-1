Here's the Java code signature with comments, matching your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * calculate the average of an array of numbers
 *
 * @param array An array of integers for which the average is to be calculated.
 * @returns The average (mean) of the array's elements, or NaN if the array is empty.
 */
public static double getArrayAverage(int[] array) {
}
```
