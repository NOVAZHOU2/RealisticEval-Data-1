Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments retained:

```cpp
/**
 * calculate the average of an array of numbers
 *
 * @param array - A vector of doubles for which the average is to be calculated.
 * @returns - The average (mean) of the vector's elements, or NaN if the vector is empty.
 */
double getArrayAverage(const std::vector<double>& array) {
}
```

### Explanation:
- The C++ function now uses `std::vector<double>` instead of an array.
- The comments have been adjusted to reflect C++ terminology.
