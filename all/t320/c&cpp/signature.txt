Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments that match your JavaScript documentation:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate the average of an array of numbers
 *
 * @param array - A pointer to an array of numbers for which the average is to be calculated.
 * @param size - The number of elements in the array.
 * @return The average (mean) of the array's elements, or NaN if the array is empty.
 */
double getArrayAverage(double* array, int size);
```

### Explanation:
- **`double* array`**: This parameter points to an array of `double` values. It allows you to pass an array of any size to the function.
- **`int size`**: This parameter specifies the number of elements in the array. It helps the function know how many elements it should consider when calculating the average.
- **`double`**: The return type is `double`, which can represent both integer and floating-point averages.

This C++ function signature ensures that the caller provides the necessary information about the array (its contents and its size), making it possible to compute the average correctly.
