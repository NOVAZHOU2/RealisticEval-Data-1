Certainly! Below is an example of how you might convert a Python unittest test case to a C++ Catch2 test case for a hypothetical function `extract_text_from_pdf`. Note that in this example, I'll assume the function `extract_text_from_pdf` is implemented and available in your C++ codebase.

### Python Unittest Test Case Example

```python
import unittest
from pdf_utils import extract_text_from_pdf  # Assuming the function is defined here

class TestExtractTextFromPDF(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_extract_text_from_pdf(self):
        file_path = "test.pdf"
        expected_text = "This is a test PDF."
        
        result = extract_text_from_pdf(file_path)
        
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Equivalent C++ Catch2 Test Case

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include "pdf_utils.h"  // Assuming the function is declared here

TEST_CASE("Extract Text From PDF", "[pdf]") {
    std::string file_path = "test.pdf";
    std::string expected_text = "This is a test PDF.";
    
    std::string result = extract_text_from_pdf(file_path);
    
    REQUIRE(result == expected_text);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The first line includes the Catch2 header file, which provides the necessary macros and utilities for writing tests.
   
2. **Test Case Declaration**: The `TEST_CASE` macro is used to declare a new test case. It takes two arguments: the name of the test case and a tag or category for filtering.
   
3. **File Path and Expected Result**: Similar to the Python code, we define the file path and the expected text.
   
4. **Function Call**: We call the `extract_text_from_pdf` function with the provided file path and store the result.
   
5. **Assertion**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to assert that the result matches the expected text. If the assertion fails, the test will fail and provide an error message.

Make sure that the `pdf_utils.h` header file is correctly set up and contains the declaration of the `extract_text_from_pdf` function. This setup assumes that the function is already implemented and compiled into your project.
