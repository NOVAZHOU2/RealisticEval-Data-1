Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Extracts text from a given PDF file.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the PDF file from which to extract text.
 *
 * @return The extracted text from the PDF.
 */
std::string extract_text_from_pdf(const std::string& file_path);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same structure and documentation style as your original Python function. Note that in C++, we typically use `const` to indicate that the function does not modify the input parameters.
