Here's how you can translate the Python function signature into Java:

```java
/**
 * Extracts text from a given PDF file.
 *
 * @param filePath The path to the PDF file from which to extract text.
 * @return The extracted text from the PDF.
 */
public String extractTextFromPdf(String filePath);
```

Please note that in Java, we use `String` for string types and don't need to specify return type for methods inside interfaces or abstract classes. If this method is part of a class, it should be declared with an appropriate access modifier (like `public`, `private`, etc.).
