Sure! Below is the TypeScript code signature with comments that mirrors the Python function you provided:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts text from a given PDF file.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the PDF file from which to extract text.
 * @returns The extracted text from the PDF.
 */
function extractTextFromPdf(filePath: string): Promise<string>;
```

In TypeScript, we use `Promise` to handle asynchronous operations like reading files. If your actual implementation involves asynchronous operations, make sure to return a `Promise`.
