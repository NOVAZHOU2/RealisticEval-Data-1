Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Copies the contents of the source file to the destination file using a buffered stream
 * and measures the time it takes to complete the operation.
 *
 * @param {string} sourceFilePath - The path to the source file.
 * @param {string} destinationFilePath - The path to the destination file.
 * @returns {number} The time taken to copy the file in milliseconds.
 */
function copyFileWithBufferedStream(sourceFilePath, destinationFilePath) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: The Python function `def` is replaced with the `function` keyword in JavaScript.
2. **Parameter Types**: Python type hints (`: str`) are replaced with JSDoc types (`@param {string}`).
3. **Return Type**: The return type hint (`-> int`) is replaced with `@returns {number}` in JSDoc format.
4. **Docstring**: The original docstring is converted into a JSDoc comment block.

This structure maintains clarity and ensures that the purpose and functionality of the code are preserved.
