Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function signature, with the docstring converted to JSDoc style:

```typescript
/**
 * Copies the contents of the source file to the destination file using a buffered stream
 * and measures the time it takes to complete the operation.
 *
 * @param sourceFilePath - The path to the source file.
 * @param destinationFilePath - The path to the destination file.
 * @returns The time taken to copy the file in milliseconds.
 */
function copyFileWithBufferedStream(sourceFilePath: string, destinationFilePath: string): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- Converted the function signature and types from Python to TypeScript.
- Translated the docstring to a JSDoc comment format.
