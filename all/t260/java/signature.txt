Here's how you can translate your Python function signature into Java:

```java
import java.io.*;
import org.apache.commons.csv.*;

public class CsvProcessor {
    
    /**
     * Processes a CSV file and removes rows with two or more empty columns.
     * If the file is empty, returns an empty string.
     *
     * @param filePath The path to the input CSV file.
     * @param outputPath The path where the processed CSV file will be saved.
     * @return A message indicating success or failure.
     */
    public static String processCsv(String filePath, String outputPath) {
        
        // Method implementation goes here
        
        return "Processed successfully";
    }
}
```

Note that in Java, we don't have type hints like in Python. Also, we need to handle exceptions such as `IOException` when reading from or writing to files. The Apache Commons CSV library is used for handling CSV files in Java. You might need to add it to your project dependencies.
