Sure! Below is the TypeScript code signature for your Python function `process_csv`, keeping the same structure and comments intact:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { parse, stringify } from 'csv';

/**
 * Processes a CSV file and removes rows with two or more empty columns. If the file is empty, returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param file_path - The path to the input CSV file.
 * @param output_path - The path where the processed CSV file will be saved.
 */
function processCsv(file_path: string, output_path: string): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript code uses the `fs` module for file operations and the `csv` package for parsing and stringifying CSV data. Make sure you have the `csv` package installed in your project:

```sh
npm install csv
```

The function signature includes the type annotations for the parameters and the return type (`void`).
