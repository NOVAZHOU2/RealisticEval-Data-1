Here is your Python function translated into TypeScript:

```typescript
function getRotation(matrix: number[][]): number {
    /**
     * Given an affine transformation matrix, return the corresponding rotation angle in radians.
     *
     * @param {number[][]} matrix - A 2D affine transformation matrix.
     * 
     * @returns {number} The rotation angle in radians, extracted from the affine matrix.
     */
    // Your implementation goes here...
}
```

Note that in TypeScript, you don't need to explicitly define the type of variables and functions like in Python. Also, the way you pass arguments and declare variables is slightly different from Python. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces or types for complex objects, but for simple cases like this one, it's not necessary.
