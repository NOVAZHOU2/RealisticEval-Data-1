Here is your Python function converted into TypeScript with type annotations and comments kept intact:

```typescript
import { Matrix } from 'mathjs';

/**
 * Given an affine transformation matrix, return the corresponding rotation angle in radians.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 2D affine transformation matrix.
 * @returns The rotation angle in radians, extracted from the affine matrix.
 */
function getRotation(matrix: Matrix): number {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that `Matrix` is a type provided by the mathjs library which needs to be installed in your project for it to work. If you don't have mathjs installed, you can add it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install mathjs
# or
yarn add mathjs
```
