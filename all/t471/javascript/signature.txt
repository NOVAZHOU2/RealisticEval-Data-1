Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code with the same function signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Given an affine transformation matrix, return the corresponding rotation angle in radians.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A 2D affine transformation matrix.
 * @returns {number} The rotation angle in radians, extracted from the affine matrix.
 */
function getRotation(matrix) {
    // Your code here...
}
```

In JavaScript, arrays are used instead of NumPy arrays, and functions don't have explicit type annotations like they do in TypeScript or other languages that support static typing. However, you can use JSDoc style comments to add type information for documentation purposes.
