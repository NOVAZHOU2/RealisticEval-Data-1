Certainly! Below is the C++ function signature for the given Python function, keeping the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Flattens a nested list into a single list.
 *
 * @param nestedList A vector that may contain nested vectors.
 * @return A flattened version of the input vector.
 */
std::vector<int> flatten(const std::vector<std::variant<int, std::vector<int>>>& nestedList);
```

### Explanation:
- `std::vector<int>`: This represents the return type, which is a flat list of integers.
- `const std::vector<std::variant<int, std::vector<int>>>`: This is the parameter type, which is a vector that can contain either an integer or another vector of integers. The use of `std::variant` allows handling both types within the same container.

This signature assumes that the nested list can contain integers and other nested lists. If your specific use case requires handling different types differently, you might need to adjust the type definitions accordingly.
