Sure, here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function signature:

```javascript
/**
 * Flattens a nested list into a single array.
 *
 * @param {Array} nestedList - A list that may contain nested arrays.
 * @returns {Array} A flattened version of the input array.
 */
```

This comment block uses JSDoc syntax, which is commonly used in JavaScript for documentation purposes. The `@param` tag specifies the name and type of each parameter, while the `@returns` tag describes the return value and its type.
