Certainly! I will convert the Python function signature and comments into equivalent JavaScript syntax, including JSDoc comments. Hereâ€™s the converted code:

```javascript
/**
 * Flattens a nested array into a single array.
 *
 * @param {Array} nestedList - An array that may contain nested arrays.
 * @returns {Array} A flattened version of the input array.
 */
function flatten(nestedList) {
    const flattened = [];  // Array to hold the flattened elements

    for (let element of nestedList) {
        if (Array.isArray(element)) {
            // Recursively flatten the nested array and concatenate the results
            flattened.push(...flatten(element));
        } else {
            // If the element is not an array, push it directly
            flattened.push(element);
        }
    }

    return flattened;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`.
   - The description of the function is included within the comment block.
   - The `@param` tag is used to document the parameter `nestedList` with its type and description.
   - The `@returns` tag is used to document the return value with its type and description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `flatten` is defined with a single parameter `nestedList`.

3. **Flattened Array**:
   - An empty array `flattened` is initialized to store the flattened elements.

4. **Loop Through Elements**:
   - A `for...of` loop iterates through each element in `nestedList`.

5. **Check for Arrays**:
   - The `Array.isArray()` method checks if the current element is an array.
   - If it is an array, the function calls itself recursively to flatten the nested array and uses the spread operator (`...`) to concatenate the results into `flattened`.
   - If it is not an array, the element is directly pushed into `flattened`.

6. **Return Flattened Array**:
   - The function returns the `flattened` array once all elements have been processed.

This JavaScript code preserves the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code, including proper documentation using JSDoc comments.
