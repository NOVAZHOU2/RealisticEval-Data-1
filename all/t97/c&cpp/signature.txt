Here's the C++ code signature for your JavaScript `Queue` class, with comments preserved:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * realize the basic functions of the question structure queue: enqueue, dequeue, get the front element of the queue, judge whether it is empty, output all elements
 */
class Queue {
private:
    std::vector<int> items; // Change type as needed

public:
    /**
     * Adds an element to the end of the queue.
     * @param element - The element to be added to the queue.
     */
    void enqueue(int element);

    /**
     * Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
     * @returns The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
     */
    std::string dequeue();

    /**
     * Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
     * @returns The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
     */
    std::string front();

    /**
     * Checks if the queue is empty.
     * @returns True if the queue is empty, otherwise false.
     */
    bool isEmpty();

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
     * @returns A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
     */
    std::string printQueue();
};
```

You can modify the type of `items` if needed.
