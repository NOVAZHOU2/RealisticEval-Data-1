Certainly! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the same comments and method signatures as the provided JavaScript code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Realize the basic functions of the queue structure: enqueue, dequeue, get the front element of the queue, judge whether it is empty, output all elements
 */
class Queue {
public:
    Queue() : items() {}

    /**
     * Adds an element to the end of the queue.
     * @param T element - The element to be added to the queue.
     */
    void enqueue(const T& element) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
     * @returns T The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
     */
    T dequeue() {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
     * @returns T The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
     */
    T front() const {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Checks if the queue is empty.
     * @returns bool True if the queue is empty, otherwise false.
     */
    bool isEmpty() const {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
     * @returns std::string A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
     */
    std::string printQueue() const {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

private:
    std::vector<T> items;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Class Definition**: The `Queue` class is defined with member functions for enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty, and printQueue.
- **Member Variables**: The `items` vector is used to store the elements of the queue.
- **Method Signatures**: Each method has its signature and comments preserved, just like in the JavaScript code.

This C++ code provides the same method signatures and comments as the JavaScript code, ensuring that the structure and documentation are consistent.
