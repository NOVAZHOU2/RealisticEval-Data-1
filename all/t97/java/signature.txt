Certainly! Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the same comments and method signatures as the provided JavaScript code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * Realizes the basic functions of the queue structure: enqueue, dequeue, get the front element of the queue,
 * judge whether it is empty, and output all elements.
 */
public class Queue<T> {
    private ArrayList<T> items;

    /**
     * Constructor for the Queue class.
     */
    public Queue() {
        this.items = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    /**
     * Adds an element to the end of the queue.
     * @param element The element to be added to the queue.
     */
    public void enqueue(T element) {
    }

    /**
     * Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
     * @return The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
     */
    public T dequeue() {
    }

    /**
     * Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
     * @return The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
     */
    public T front() {
    }

    /**
     * Checks if the queue is empty.
     * @return True if the queue is empty, otherwise false.
     */
    public boolean isEmpty() {
    }

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
     * @return A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
     */
    public String printQueue() {
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Class Definition**: The `Queue` class is defined with a generic type `T` to allow storing any type of elements.
- **Constructor**: Initializes an `ArrayList` to store the queue elements.
- **enqueue**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- **dequeue**: Removes and returns the first element of the queue.
- **front**: Returns the first element of the queue without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
- **printQueue**: Returns a string representation of the queue elements, separated by spaces.

The method signatures and comments are preserved to match the original JavaScript code.
