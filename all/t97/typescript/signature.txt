Certainly! Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of your JavaScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Realize the basic functions of the queue structure: enqueue, dequeue, get the front element of the queue, judge whether it is empty, output all elements
 */
class Queue<T> {
    private items: T[] = [];

    /**
     * Adds an element to the end of the queue.
     * @param {T} element - The element to be added to the queue.
     */
    enqueue(element: T): void {
    }

    /**
     * Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
     * @returns {T | string} The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
     */
    dequeue(): T | string {
    }

    /**
     * Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
     * @returns {T | string} The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
     */
    front(): T | string {
    }

    /**
     * Checks if the queue is empty.
     * @returns {boolean} True if the queue is empty, otherwise false.
     */
    isEmpty(): boolean {
    }

    /**
     * Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
     * @returns {string} A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
     */
    printQueue(): string {
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Generic Type `T`**: The class `Queue` is now generic, allowing it to handle any type of elements.
2. **Type Annotations**: Added type annotations for method parameters and return types.
3. **Private Property**: The `items` array is marked as `private` to indicate that it should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
4. **Non-nullable Return Types**: Methods like `dequeue` and `front` return either the type `T` or a string indicating an error state.

This conversion ensures that the TypeScript code is type-safe and follows best practices while preserving the original comments and structure.
