Here is the equivalent Python code that implements the same queue functionality as the provided JavaScript code. The Python version includes all the methods and comments, maintaining the functionality described.
Python Code for Queue Class
python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializes an empty queue."""
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, element):
        """
        Adds an element to the end of the queue.
        
        Args:
            element: The element to be added to the queue.
        """
        self.items.append(element)

    def dequeue(self):
        """
        Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
        
        Returns:
            The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
        """
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Underflow"
        return self.items.pop(0)

    def front(self):
        """
        Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
        
        Returns:
            The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
        """
        if self.is_empty():
            return "No elements in Queue"
        return self.items[0]

    def is_empty(self):
        """
        Checks if the queue is empty.
        
        Returns:
            True if the queue is empty, otherwise False.
        """
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def print_queue(self):
        """
        Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
        
        Returns:
            A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
        """
        return " ".join(map(str, self.items))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue = Queue()
    queue.enqueue(1)
    queue.enqueue(2)
    queue.enqueue(3)
    print(queue.print_queue())  # Output: "1 2 3"
    print(queue.front())         # Output: "1"
    print(queue.dequeue())       # Output: "1"
    print(queue.print_queue())   # Output: "2 3"
    print(queue.is_empty())      # Output: False
Explanation of the Python Code
Class Definition:
The Queue class is defined similarly to the JavaScript class. The constructor is implemented with the __init__ method.
Method Definitions:
Each method in the JavaScript class corresponds to a method in the Python class:
enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue using append().
dequeue: Removes and returns the front element using pop(0), which simulates the behavior of a queue. If the queue is empty, it returns "Underflow".
front: Returns the front element without removing it, or a message if the queue is empty.
is_empty: Checks if the queue is empty by comparing the length of self.items.
print_queue: Returns a string of all elements joined by spaces using the join method and map to convert elements to strings.
Example Usage:
An example usage section is provided to demonstrate how to use the queue, showing the output of various operations.
This Python implementation maintains the functionality of the original JavaScript code while adhering to Python's conventions and syntax.
