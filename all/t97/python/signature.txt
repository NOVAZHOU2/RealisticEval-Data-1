Hereâ€™s how you can translate the JavaScript Queue class signature into a Python class signature with the same functionality. The comments and methods have been adapted to fit Python's syntax and conventions.
python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize an empty queue."""
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, element):
        """Adds an element to the end of the queue.
        
        Args:
            element: The element to be added to the queue.
        """
        self.items.append(element)

    def dequeue(self):
        """Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
        
        Returns:
            The removed element from the front of the queue, or "Underflow" if the queue is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)
        return "Underflow"

    def front(self):
        """Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
        
        Returns:
            The front element of the queue, or "No elements in Queue" if the queue is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        return "No elements in Queue"

    def is_empty(self):
        """Checks if the queue is empty.
        
        Returns:
            True if the queue is empty, otherwise False.
        """
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def print_queue(self):
        """Returns a string representation of all the elements in the queue.
        
        Returns:
            A string containing all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
        """
        return ' '.join(map(str, self.items))
Explanation of the Code:
Constructor (__init__): Initializes an empty list to hold the queue elements.
enqueue(element): Appends the given element to the end of the list representing the queue.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the first element of the list. If the queue is empty, it returns "Underflow".
front(): Returns the first element of the list without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns "No elements in Queue".
is_empty(): Checks if the list is empty and returns a boolean value.
print_queue(): Returns a string with all elements in the queue, separated by spaces.
This Python code maintains the intended functionality of the JavaScript code while adapting to Python's conventions and syntax.
