Here’s the conversion of the provided TypeScript code signature into Python code signature while keeping the comments intact:
python
# Define the Coordinates type to represent a point in 2D space
Coordinates = dict[str, float]

def get_bezier_point(t: float, points: list[Coordinates]) -> Coordinates:
    """ 
    Recursively calculates a point on a Bézier curve using De Casteljau's algorithm.

    Args:
        t: A value between 0 and 1 representing the interpolation parameter.
        points: A list of control points defining the Bézier curve.

    Returns:
        The calculated Coordinates at the given parameter t.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of the Conversion:
Type Definition:
The Coordinates type is defined as a dictionary with string keys and float values, using dict[str, float] in Python.
Function Signature:
The function name is converted to get_bezier_point to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
The parameters are typed as follows:
t: float: indicates that t is a float.
points: list[Coordinates]: indicates that points is a list of Coordinates.
The return type is specified as -> Coordinates, indicating that the function will return a Coordinates type.
Docstring:
The docstring retains the original comments from TypeScript, explaining the purpose of the function and its parameters.
Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is included as a placeholder for the implementation.
This Python function signature preserves the structure and comments from the original TypeScript code.
