Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature for the `findMedian` function, keeping the comments similar to your JavaScript version:

```cpp
/**
 * Finds the median of a given array of numbers.
 * 
 * @param arr - The vector of integers to find the median of.
 */
double findMedian(std::vector<int>& arr) {

}
```

### Explanation:
- The C++ function signature specifies that the function returns a `double` (for the median).
- It takes a reference to a `std::vector<int>` as a parameter, which is the C++ equivalent of the JavaScript array.
- The comments are preserved and adapted to the C++ context.
