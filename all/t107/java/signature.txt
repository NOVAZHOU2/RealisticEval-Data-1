Certainly! Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments and structure:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MedianFinder {

    /**
     * Finds the median of a given array of numbers.
     * 
     * @param arr The array of numbers to find the median of.
     */
    public static void findMedian(int[] arr) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int[] largeArray = new int[10001];
        for (int i = 0; i < largeArray.length; i++) {
            largeArray[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 10000);
        }

        findMedian(largeArray);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Java Method Signature**:
   - The method `findMedian` is defined with the signature `public static void findMedian(int[] arr)`.
   - This matches the JavaScript function signature but with the appropriate Java syntax.

2. **Comments**:
   - The comments are kept exactly as in the JavaScript code.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - In the `main` method, a large array is created and filled with random numbers.
   - The `findMedian` method is called with this array.

This ensures that the method signature and comments are preserved while adapting to Java syntax.
