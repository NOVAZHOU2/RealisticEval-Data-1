Here's the Java code signature with comments, matching the structure of your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Finds the median of a given array of numbers.
 * 
 * @param arr - The array of numbers to find the median of.
 */
public static double findMedian(int[] arr) {
    
}
```

This maintains the comments and adjusts the function signature for Java.
