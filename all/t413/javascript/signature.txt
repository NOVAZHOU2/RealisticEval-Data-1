Certainly! I will convert the Python function signature and comments into equivalent JavaScript syntax, including JSDoc comments for proper documentation. Hereâ€™s the converted code:

```javascript
/**
 * Filter out the number of palindromes within any number n. Palindrome numbers are numbers with the same forward and reverse readings, such as 121, 1331.
 *
 * @param {number} n - The range number.
 * @returns {Array<number>} - An array of palindrome numbers.
 */
function getPalindromeList(n) {
    const isPalindrome = (str) => str === str.split('').reverse().join('');

    const palindromes = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i)
                             .filter(x => isPalindrome(x.toString()))
                             .map(Number);

    return palindromes;
}

// Example usage
console.log(getPalindromeList(100));
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block is placed above the function definition.
   - It includes a brief description of what the function does.
   - It specifies the parameter type (`n`) and its description.
   - It specifies the return type (`Array<number>`) and its description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `getPalindromeList` is defined with a single parameter `n`.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - A helper function `isPalindrome` is defined to check if a string is a palindrome.

4. **Array Creation and Filtering**:
   - An array is created using `Array.from` with a length of `n`, where each element is its index.
   - The `.filter` method is used to filter out elements that are palindromes by converting them to strings and checking with `isPalindrome`.
   - The `.map(Number)` converts the filtered strings back to numbers.

This JavaScript code preserves the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code, and it includes proper JSDoc comments for documentation.
