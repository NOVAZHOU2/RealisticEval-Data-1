Here is the JavaScript version of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Filter out the number of palindrome within any number n. Palindrome numbers are numbers with the same correction and reverse readings, such as 121, 1331
 *
 * @param {number} n - range number
 * @returns {Array<number>} - Palindrome numbers
 */
function getPalindromeList(n) {
```

This JavaScript function has the same purpose as the original Python function. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns an array of integers that are palindromes within the range from 0 to `n`. The JSDoc comment at the top of the function provides information about what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
