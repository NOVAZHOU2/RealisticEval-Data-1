Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python code signature:

```typescript
/**
 * Filter out the number of palindrome within any number n. Palindrome numbers are numbers with the same correction and reverse readings, such as 121, 1331
 *
 * @param {number} n - range number
 * @returns {number[]} Palindrome numbers
 */
function getPalindromeList(n: number): number[] {
```

This TypeScript function signature maintains the original functionality and comments while adapting to TypeScript's syntax.
