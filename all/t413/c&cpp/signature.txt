Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * @brief Filters out the number of palindromes within any number n.
 * Palindrome numbers are numbers with the same correction and reverse readings, such as 121, 1331.
 *
 * @param n The range number
 * @return std::vector<int> A vector containing palindrome numbers
 */
std::vector<int> get_palindrome_list(int n);
```

This C++ function signature does not include the implementation details or the logic for checking if a number is a palindrome. It only declares the function prototype with its parameters and return type, along with a docstring-like comment that describes what the function does.
