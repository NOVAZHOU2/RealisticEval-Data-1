Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python function:

```javascript
function prependToEachLine(filePath, prefix) {
    /**
     * Prepends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
     *
     * @param {string} filePath - Path to the file whose lines will be modified.
     * @param {string} prefix - String to prepend to the beginning of each line.
     */

    // Read the file content
    const fs = require('fs');
    let data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');

    // Split the data into lines
    let lines = data.split('\n');

    // Prepend the prefix to each line
    lines = lines.map(line => prefix + line);

    // Join the lines back together
    data = lines.join('\n');

    // Write the modified content back to the file
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, data, 'utf8');
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the File**: The `fs.readFileSync` method is used to read the entire contents of the file synchronously.
2. **Splitting Lines**: The `split('\n')` method splits the file content into an array of lines.
3. **Prepending Prefix**: The `map` function is used to iterate over each line and prepend the specified prefix to it.
4. **Joining Lines**: The `join('\n')` method joins the modified lines back into a single string with newline characters.
5. **Writing Back to File**: The `fs.writeFileSync` method writes the modified content back to the file synchronously.

Make sure you have Node.js installed to run this JavaScript code, as it uses the built-in `fs` module for file operations.
