Here is the equivalent JavaScript function with corresponding JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Prepends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
 * 
 * @param {string} file_path - Path to the file whose lines will be modified.
 * @param {string} prefix - String to prepend to the beginning of each line.
 */
function prependToEachLine(filePath, prefix) {
    // Implementation goes here.
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function is not provided here, only the function signature and comments have been converted.
