Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same functionality and comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Appends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the file whose lines will be modified.
 * @param prefix The string to append to the beginning of each line.
 */
void prependToEachLine(const std::string& file_path, const std::string& prefix);
```

This C++ function signature does not include the implementation details, but it retains the documentation comments that explain the purpose of the function and its parameters.
