Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Prepends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
 *
 * @param filePath Path to the file whose lines will be modified.
 * @param prefix   String to prepend to the beginning of each line.
 */
public static void prependToEachLine(String filePath, String prefix) {
```

This method signature in Java follows the typical Java conventions for method declarations, including the use of `static` if it's part of a utility class and the inclusion of Javadoc-style comments for documentation purposes.
