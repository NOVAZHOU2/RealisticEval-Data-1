Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function, including the documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Prepends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
 * 
 * @param file_path - Path to the file whose lines will be modified.
 * @param prefix - String to prepend to the beginning of each line.
 */
function prependToEachLine(filePath: string, prefix: string): void {
    // Implementation would go here
}
```

Note: The actual implementation of reading and writing to files would need to be added within the function body based on your requirements or the specific Node.js or browser environment you are working in. The function signature and documentation comments have been translated as requested.
