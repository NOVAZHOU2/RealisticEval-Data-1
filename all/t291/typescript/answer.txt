Here is how you can convert your Python function into TypeScript:

```typescript
function prependToEachLine(filePath: string, prefix: string) {
    /**
     * Prepends the specified string to the beginning of each line of the file.
     *
     * @param filePath - Path to the file whose lines will be modified.
     * @param prefix - String to prepend to the beginning of each line.
     */
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `function` keyword instead of `def`, and we don't need to specify types in the function parameters because TypeScript infers them from the context. However, it's good practice to include types for clarity. The type of `filePath` and `prefix` are both `string`.
