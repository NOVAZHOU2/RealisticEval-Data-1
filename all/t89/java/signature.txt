Here's the Java code signature with comments converted from the JavaScript version:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the elapsed time from a given start time in milliseconds and returns
 * it as a formatted string in "minutes:seconds" format.
 *
 * @param startTimeInMillis The start time in milliseconds.
 * @return A string representing the elapsed time in minutes and seconds.
 */
public static String timePassed(long startTimeInMillis) {
}
```

This keeps the comments and structure aligned with Java's syntax.
