To convert the JavaScript code signature and documentation comment to Python, you'll want to adapt the docstring format and the function signature to match Python conventions. Below is how you can represent the JavaScript function signature and its documentation in Python:
Converted Python Code Signature with Docstring
python
def time_passed(start_time_in_millis: int) -> str:
    """
    Calculates the elapsed time from a given start time in milliseconds and returns 
    it as a formatted string in "minutes:seconds" format.

    Args:
        start_time_in_millis (int): The start time in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the elapsed time in minutes and seconds.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
Explanation:
Function Name: The function name is changed to time_passed, following Python's naming conventions (typically using snake_case).
Parameters:
The parameter start_time_in_millis is defined with its type hint as int, indicating that it expects an integer.
Return Type:
The return type is specified as str, indicating that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The docstring follows Python's convention of triple quotes for documentation.
It explains the function's purpose, parameters, and return values clearly.
Placeholder Implementation:
The pass statement acts as a placeholder for where the actual function logic would go.
This signature and docstring format is aligned with Python's conventions for writing clear and maintainable code.
