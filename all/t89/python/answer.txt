Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function into Python. The equivalent Python code will use the time module to get the current time in milliseconds and then perform the necessary calculations to format the time passed since startTimeInMillis.
Converted Python Code:
python
import time

def time_passed(start_time_in_millis: int) -> str:
    """
    Calculate the time passed since the start time in milliseconds and return a formatted string.

    Args:
        start_time_in_millis (int): The start time in milliseconds.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the time passed in the format 'minutes:seconds'.
    """
    # Get the current time in milliseconds
    current_time_in_millis = int(time.time() * 1000)
    
    # Calculate the difference in milliseconds
    time_difference = current_time_in_millis - start_time_in_millis
    
    # Convert the difference to seconds
    total_seconds = time_difference // 1000
    
    # Calculate minutes and seconds
    minutes = total_seconds // 60
    seconds = total_seconds % 60
    
    # Return the formatted string
    return f"{minutes}:{seconds:02}"

# Example usage
start_time = int(time.time() * 1000) - 125000  # 125 seconds ago
print(time_passed(start_time))  # Output will vary based on the current time
Explanation:
Imports: The time module is imported to work with timestamps.
Function Definition: The function time_passed accepts start_time_in_millis as an argument.
Current Time: The current time in milliseconds is obtained using int(time.time() * 1000), which converts the current time from seconds to milliseconds.
Time Difference: The time difference in milliseconds is calculated by subtracting the start time from the current time.
Conversion to Seconds: The difference is converted to seconds by using integer division (//).
Minutes and Seconds Calculation: Minutes are calculated by dividing total seconds by 60, and seconds are calculated using the modulus operator (%) to get the remainder.
Formatted String: The function returns a formatted string that ensures seconds are always two digits using the format specification :02.
Example Usage: An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to call the function with a start_time that is 125 seconds in the past.
This code replicates the functionality of the original JavaScript function in Python effectively.
