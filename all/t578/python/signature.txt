Hereâ€™s how to convert the provided TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while keeping the comments intact:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def is_kebab_case(input: str) -> bool:
    """
    Detects whether the string is in KEBAB_CASE.

    :param input: The string to check.
    :return: True if the string is in KEBAB_CASE, otherwise False.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
Changed isKebabCase to is_kebab_case, following Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Parameters:
The parameter input: str specifies that the function expects a string.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated as -> bool, meaning the function will return a boolean value.
Docstring:
The original comments are preserved in the docstring format, which is standard for Python documentation. It describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
Function Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is included to indicate where the function implementation should be added later.
This signature can now be used in your Python code, serving as a clear and informative definition for the is_kebab_case function.
