Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted to a Python function signature. The comments have been translated to Python style comments.
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def circle_intersection_area(x1: float, y1: float, r1: float, x2: float, y2: float, r2: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the intersection area of two circles. Each circle is defined by its center coordinates and radius.

    :param x1: The x-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
    :param y1: The y-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
    :param r1: The radius of the first circle.
    :param x2: The x-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
    :param y2: The y-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
    :param r2: The radius of the second circle.
    :return: The area of the intersection between the two circles.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Key Changes Made:
Function Name:
Changed from circleIntersectionArea to circle_intersection_area to follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Annotations:
Added type hints for parameters and the return type using the Python syntax.
Each parameter is annotated with float to indicate that they expect floating-point numbers.
Docstring:
Converted the C++ comment block to a Python docstring.
The format of the parameters and return value descriptions is adjusted to follow Python conventions using :param and :return.
Function Body:
Included a placeholder (pass) to indicate where the implementation would go.
You can now implement the function logic inside this Python signature as needed.
