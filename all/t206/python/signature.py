    Calculate the intersection area of two circles. Each circle is defined by its center coordinates and radius.

    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
        r1 (float): The radius of the first circle.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
        r2 (float): The radius of the second circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the intersection between the two circles.
