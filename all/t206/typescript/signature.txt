Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of the provided C++ function signature with comments converted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the intersection area of two circles. Each circle is defined by its center coordinates and radius.
 *
 * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
 * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the center of the first circle.
 * @param r1 The radius of the first circle.
 * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
 * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the center of the second circle.
 * @param r2 The radius of the second circle.
 * @returns The area of the intersection between the two circles.
 */
function circleIntersectionArea(x1: number, y1: number, r1: number, x2: number, y2: number, r2: number): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the original structure while adapting to TypeScript conventions. Would you like to see the implementation converted as well?
