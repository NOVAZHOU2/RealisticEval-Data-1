To convert the JavaScript code signature, which includes documentation comments, to Python, we will use a docstring format that is commonly used in Python. Hereâ€™s how the equivalent Python code signature would look:
Python Function Signature with Docstring
python
def toroidal_diff(this_point: dict, other_point: dict, width: float, height: float) -> list:
    """
    Calculates the toroidal difference between two points.

    Parameters:
    this_point (dict): The first point with keys 'x' and 'y'.
    other_point (dict): The second point with keys 'x' and 'y'.
    width (float): The width of the toroidal space.
    height (float): The height of the toroidal space.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the x and y differences, accounting for wrap-around.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
Breakdown of Changes
Function Name:
Converted toroidalDiff to toroidal_diff to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Parameter Types:
Specified parameter types using type hints:
this_point and other_point are typed as dict to indicate they should be dictionaries with keys x and y.
width and height are typed as float to represent numeric values.
The return type is specified as list.
Docstring Format:
Used triple quotes (""") for the docstring, which is the standard in Python for documentation.
The description and parameter details are formatted in a way that is clear and Pythonic, adhering to common conventions.
Placeholder for Implementation:
Added pass as a placeholder for the actual function implementation, similar to an empty function in JavaScript.
This format provides clear documentation and type hints, making the function's purpose and usage understandable in Python.
