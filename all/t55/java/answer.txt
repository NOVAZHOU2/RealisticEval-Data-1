Here is the equivalent Java code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Answer {
    public static int minRemovalsToMakeUnique(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (map.containsKey(i)) {
                count++;
                i++;
                while (map.containsKey(i)) {
                    i++;
                    count++;
                }
            }
            map.put(i, 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

This Java code sorts the input array first and then iterates through it. If a number appears more than once, it increments the count and continues until it finds a unique number. It also keeps track of all the numbers it has seen in a HashMap.

Please note that Python uses dynamic typing, whereas Java is statically typed, which means you need to declare the data type of each variable when you create it. Also, Python's `typing` module provides support for type hints, but they are not enforced at runtime. In contrast, Java enforces types at compile time.
