Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python function:

```javascript
function minRemovalsToMakeUnique(nums) {
    let map = new Map();
    let count = 0;

    // Count occurrences of each number
    for(let num of nums){
        if(map.has(num)){
            map.set(num, map.get(num)+1);
        }else{
            map.set(num, 1);
        }
    }

    // Iterate over map and adjust counts
    for(let [key, value] of map.entries()){
        while(value > 1){
            value--;
            count++;
            key++;
            if(!map.has(key)){
                map.set(key, 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

In this JavaScript version, we're using a `Map` object instead of a dictionary to keep track of how many times each number appears in the array. We then iterate over this map, decrementing the count until it's less than or equal to one. If a count has been decremented to zero, we remove that entry from the map. The total count of removed entries is returned at the end.
