Here's the JavaScript equivalent for your Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Rotates the elements of the array to the left by one position. The first element
 * is moved to the end of the array, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} elements - An array of numbers to be rotated.
 * @return {Array<number>} The rotated array with elements shifted to the left by one position.
 */
function rotateArrayElements(elements) {
```

Note that in JavaScript, we don't need to specify types for function parameters or return values like in TypeScript. Also, arrays are used instead of lists.
