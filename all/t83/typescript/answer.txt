Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function rotateListElements(elements: number[]): number[] {
    /**
     * Rotate the elements of the array to the left by one position. The first element
     * is moved to the end of the array, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
     *
     * @param {number[]} elements - An array of numbers to be rotated.
     * @returns {number[]} The rotated array with elements shifted to the left by one position.
     */
    
    if (elements.length === 0) return [];

    const firstElement = elements.shift();
    elements.push(firstElement!);

    return elements;
}
```

This TypeScript function `rotateListElements` takes an array of numbers and rotates it to the left by one position, similar to how the Python function works. It uses the `shift()` method to remove the first element and then pushes it to the end of the array using the `push()` method. If the input array is empty, it simply returns an empty array.
