Here's how you can convert your Python function signature into TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Rotate the elements of the array to the left by one position. The first element
 * is moved to the end of the array, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
 *
 * @param {number[]} elements - An array of numbers to be rotated.
 * @returns {number[]} The rotated array with elements shifted to the left by one position.
 */
function rotateArrayElements(elements: number[]): number[] {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- `List` in Python has been replaced with `number[]`, which represents an array of numbers.
- The type annotations for the parameters and return value have been added using TypeScript syntax (`: number[]`).
