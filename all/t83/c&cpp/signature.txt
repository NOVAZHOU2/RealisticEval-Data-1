```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

/**
 * Rotate the elements of the vector to the left by one position. The first element
 * is moved to the end of the vector, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
 *
 * @param elements A vector of integers to be rotated.
 * @return The rotated vector with elements shifted to the left by one position.
 */
std::vector<int> rotate_vector_elements(std::vector<int>& elements) {
    if (!elements.empty()) {
        std::rotate(elements.begin(), elements.begin() + 1, elements.end());
    }
    return elements;
}
```

This C++ function `rotate_vector_elements` takes a reference to a vector of integers and rotates its elements to the left by one position using the `std::rotate` algorithm from the `<algorithm>` header. If the vector is empty, it simply returns the original vector without any changes.
