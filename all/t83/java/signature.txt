Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, including appropriate Javadoc comments and Java conventions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Class containing methods to rotate list elements.
 */
public class Answer {

    /**
     * Rotates the elements of the list to the left by one position. The first element
     * is moved to the end of the list, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
     *
     * @param elements A list of integers to be rotated.
     * @return The rotated list with elements shifted to the left by one position.
     */
    public static List<Integer> rotateListElements(List<Integer> elements) {
        if (elements.size() > 1) {
            List<Integer> rotated = new ArrayList<>(elements.subList(1, elements.size()));
            rotated.add(elements.get(0));
            return rotated;
        }
        return elements;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> elements = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
        List<Integer> rotatedElements = rotateListElements(elements);
        System.out.println(rotatedElements); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
2. **Imports**: The necessary imports for `ArrayList` and `List` are included.
3. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined.
4. **Javadoc Comments**: The Javadoc comments are added to provide detailed documentation for the method.
5. **Method `rotateListElements`**:
   - This method takes a `List<Integer>` as input and returns a new list with the elements rotated to the left by one position.
   - It checks if the list has more than one element before performing the rotation.
   - If the condition is met, it creates a new `ArrayList` containing all elements except the first one and then adds the first element at the end.
6. **Main Method**: A simple `main` method is provided to demonstrate the usage of the `rotateListElements` method.

This Java code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code while adhering to Java's syntax and conventions.
