Here's the equivalent Java code signature for the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Rotates the elements of the list to the left by one position. The first element
 * is moved to the end of the list, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.
 *
 * @param elements A list of integers to be rotated.
 * @return The rotated list with elements shifted to the left by one position.
 */
public static List<Integer> rotateListElements(List<Integer> elements) {
```

This Java method `rotateListElements` takes a `List<Integer>` as an argument and returns a `List<Integer>`. It follows the same logic as the original Python function but is written in Java syntax.
