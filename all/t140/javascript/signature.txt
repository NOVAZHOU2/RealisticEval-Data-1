Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature with comments preserved:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the years, months, days, hours, and minutes that have passed from the birth date to the current date and return them as an array. The contents of the array are the values of these units.
 * @param birthDate
 */
function getTimeSinceBornUntilNow(birthDate) {

}
```
