Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature along with the comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate the years, months, days, hours, and minutes that have passed from the birth date to the current date and return them as an array. The contents of the array are the values of these units.
 * @param birthDate The birth date.
 * @return An array containing years, months, days, hours, and minutes.
 */
std::array<int, 5> getTimeSinceBornUntilNow(const std::tm& birthDate) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Notes:
- The `std::array<int, 5>` is used to return an array of five integers.
- The `std::tm` struct from `<ctime>` is commonly used to represent date and time in C++. You might want to convert your birth date to this format before calling the function.
