Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments converted from your TypeScript code:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the years, months, days, hours, and minutes that have passed from the birth date to the current date and return them as an array. The contents of the array are the values of these units.
 * @param birthDate the date of birth
 * @return an array containing years, months, days, hours, and minutes
 */
public static int[] getTimeSinceBornUntilNow(Date birthDate) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The method is declared as `public static int[]` to indicate it returns an integer array.
- The Javadoc comment format is used to describe the method and its parameters, similar to TypeScript's documentation style.
