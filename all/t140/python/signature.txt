Sure! Hereâ€™s how you can convert the TypeScript function signature to a Python function signature while keeping the comments. The Python function will use type hints to specify the expected types for the parameters and return value.
Converted Python Function Signature
python
from datetime import datetime

def get_time_since_born_until_now(birth_date: datetime) -> tuple[int, int, int, int, int]:
    """
    Calculate the years, months, days, hours, and minutes that have passed 
    from the birth date to the current date and return them as a tuple. 
    The contents of the tuple are the values of these units.

    :param birth_date: The date of birth as a datetime object.
    :return: A tuple containing years, months, days, hours, and minutes.
    """
    # Your function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name: The function name is changed to get_time_since_born_until_now to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type: The parameter birth_date is typed as datetime, which is the Python equivalent of TypeScript's Date.
Return Type: The return type is specified as tuple[int, int, int, int, int], indicating that the function will return a tuple containing five integers.
Docstring: The comment has been converted into a docstring, which is a common way to document functions in Python. It explains what the function does, the parameter it takes, and what it returns.
You can insert the implementation of the function (as provided earlier) below this signature in your Python code.
