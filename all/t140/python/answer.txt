Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided TypeScript function getTimeSinceBornUntilNow. This code uses Python's datetime module to perform the calculations similarly to how it's done in TypeScript.
python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def get_time_since_born_until_now(birth_date: datetime) -> tuple[int, int, int, int, int]:
    now = datetime.now()

    # Calculate years
    years = now.year - birth_date.year

    # Calculate months
    months = now.month - birth_date.month
    if months < 0:
        years -= 1
        months += 12

    # Calculate days
    days = now.day - birth_date.day
    if days < 0:
        months -= 1
        # Get the last day of the previous month
        previous_month = (now.replace(day=1) - timedelta(days=1)).day
        days += previous_month

    # Calculate hours
    hours = now.hour - birth_date.hour
    if hours < 0:
        days -= 1
        hours += 24

    # Calculate minutes
    minutes = now.minute - birth_date.minute
    if minutes < 0:
        hours -= 1
        minutes += 60

    return years, months, days, hours, minutes

# Example usage:
birth_date = datetime(1990, 5, 15)  # Replace with the desired birth date
time_since_born = get_time_since_born_until_now(birth_date)
print(time_since_born)
Explanation:
Imports: The datetime module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. The timedelta class is used to perform date arithmetic.
Function Definition: The function get_time_since_born_until_now accepts a datetime object as an argument and returns a tuple of integers representing the difference in years, months, days, hours, and minutes.
Calculating Differences:
Years: The difference in years is calculated directly.
Months: If the month difference is negative, it means the current date is earlier in the year than the birth date, so one year is subtracted and 12 months are added to the current month.
Days: If the day difference is negative, it implies that the current date is earlier in the month than the birth date. It adjusts the month and adds the last day of the previous month.
Hours: The same logic applies to hours and minutes, adjusting the previous unit accordingly.
Example Usage: The example at the end demonstrates how to use the function, which you can replace with any birth date.
This Python function mirrors the functionality of the TypeScript version while adhering to Python syntax and conventions.
