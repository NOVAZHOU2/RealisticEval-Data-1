Hereâ€™s the converted Python code signature with comments changed to Python style, while preserving the original comments' content and formatting:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def print_board(board):
    """
    @brief Prints a 3x3 game board to the console.

    This function takes a 2D list representing a game board and prints 
    it in a formatted manner, displaying the contents of each cell. 
    The board is assumed to be a square of size 3x3, and each cell can 
    contain either a character representing a player's move ('X' or 'O') 
    or an empty space (' ').

    The output format includes a row of dashes to separate the rows of 
    the board, and each cell is enclosed within vertical bars. 
    The function does not return any value.

    @param board A 2D list of characters, where each character represents 
                 the state of a cell in the game board. The board must be 
                 of size 3x3, and each character can be 'X', 'O', or ' '. 
    For example: 
        input: [['X', 'O', 'X'], 
                [' ', 'X', 'O'], 
                ['O', ' ', ' ']] 
        output: -------------
                | X | O | X | 
                -------------
                |   | X | O | 
                -------------
                | O |   |   | 
                -------------

    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Changes and Notes:
Function Definition:
Changed the C++ function signature to a Python function using def.
Docstring Format:
Converted C++ style comments into a Python docstring. The triple quotes (""") are used for multi-line strings, which serve as documentation for the function.
Indentation:
The content within the docstring is properly indented to maintain clarity and organization.
Function Body:
Included a pass statement to indicate that the implementation will go here later, which is common in Python when defining a function without an implementation.
Maintaining Comments:
The original comments and their structure are preserved to ensure that the purpose and details of the function remain clear.
This structure will allow you to implement the print_board function later while retaining comprehensive documentation about its functionality.
