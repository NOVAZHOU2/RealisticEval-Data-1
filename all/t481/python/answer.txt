Hereâ€™s the converted Python code from the provided C++ code, which defines a function to print a tic-tac-toe board:
Converted Python Code
python
def print_board(board):
    """Prints the tic-tac-toe board.

    Args:
        board (list of list of str): The tic-tac-toe board to print, 
        with characters representing the players' moves.
    """
    board_size = 3  # Size of the board
    print("-------------")  # Print the top border
    # Loop through each row
    for i in range(board_size):
        print("| ", end="")  # Start of the row
        # Loop through each column in the row
        for j in range(board_size):
            print(board[i][j], end=" | ")  # Print each cell
        print()  # End of the row
        print("-------------")  # Print the row separator

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_board = [['X', 'O', 'X'],
                     ['O', 'X', 'O'],
                     [' ', 'X', ' ']]
    print_board(example_board)
Key Changes and Notes:
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def instead of void.
Arguments:
The C++ vector<vector<char>> type is replaced by a Python list of lists (list of list of str), which can hold strings or characters.
Print Statements:
The cout statements from C++ are replaced with print() functions in Python.
The end="" argument in the print() function is used to prevent a newline after printing, similar to the behavior of cout in C++.
Looping:
The C++ for-loops are replaced with Python's range() function for looping through indices.
Docstring:
A docstring is added to describe the function, its parameters, and its behavior.
Example Usage:
An example board is included to demonstrate how to call the print_board function, which prints a sample tic-tac-toe game state.
Running the Code
You can run this Python code in any Python environment. The print_board function will display the tic-tac-toe board in a formatted manner, similar to how it would appear in a console application using C++.
