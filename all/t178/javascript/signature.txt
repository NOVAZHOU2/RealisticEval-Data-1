Here’s the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments formatted using JSDoc:

```javascript
/**
 * Find the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the given array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of integers.
 * @returns {number[]} A list containing the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
 */
function findLongestNonDecreasingSubsequence(nums) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

You can replace the comment `// Function implementation goes here` with the actual logic from your Python code as needed. Let me know if you’d like me to include the complete function implementation in JavaScript!
