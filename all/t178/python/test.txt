To convert the given Java JUnit test cases to Python's unittest framework, we will make several changes:
Import Statements: We will use unittest for the test framework and directly import the Answer class containing the function to be tested.
Class Definition: In Python, we define a test case class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Test Methods: Each test method is prefixed with test_, and we will use self.assertEqual() to check for equality instead of assertEquals.
No Need for Annotations: The @Test annotation in Java is not required in Python.
Hereâ€™s how the converted Python test case would look:
python
import unittest
from typing import List

# Assuming the Answer class with the method is defined in a module named answer
from answer import Answer  # Adjust the import based on your actual file structure

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_non_decreasing_sequence(self):
        nums = [5, 7, 4, 8, 6, 10, 2, 11]
        expected: List[int] = [5, 7, 8, 10, 11]
        self.assertEqual(expected, Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums))

    def test_all_increasing(self):
        nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        expected: List[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        self.assertEqual(expected, Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums))

    def test_all_decreasing(self):
        nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        expected: List[int] = [5]
        self.assertEqual(expected, Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums))

    def test_single_element(self):
        nums = [10]
        expected: List[int] = [10]
        self.assertEqual(expected, Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums))

    def test_empty_array(self):
        nums = []
        expected: List[int] = []
        self.assertEqual(expected, Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Breakdown of the Python Code:
Imports:
unittest: For creating and running the tests.
List from typing: To specify types for better clarity (optional but recommended).
Class Definition:
TestAnswer: The class that groups our tests together. It inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Test Methods:
Each test method starts with test_, and we use self.assertEqual() to compare the expected output with the actual result from the find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence method.
Main Block:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the tests will run when this file is executed directly.
Running the Tests:
To execute these tests, save the code in a Python file (e.g., test_answer.py) and run it using a Python interpreter. This will run all defined test cases and show the results.
