To convert the Java function signature to Python, we need to consider the following:
Function Definition: In Python, the def keyword is used to define functions.
Type Annotations: Python supports type hints using the List and int types. We need to import List from the typing module for type annotations.
Parameter Types: In Java, int[] is an array of integers. In Python, this would typically be represented as a list of integers, so we will use List[int].
Here's how the Java function signature translates into a Python function signature:
python
from typing import List

def find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Breakdown:
from typing import List: This imports the List type from the typing module for type annotations.
def find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(...): This defines the function in Python.
nums: List[int]: This specifies that the nums parameter is expected to be a list of integers.
-> List[int]: This indicates that the function will return a list of integers.
pass: This is a placeholder indicating that the function implementation will be added later.
You can now implement the function logic within the pass statement as needed!
