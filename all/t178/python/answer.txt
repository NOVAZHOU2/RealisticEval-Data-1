To convert the provided Java code into Python, we can follow a structured approach, maintaining the logic while adapting to Python syntax and conventions. Below is the equivalent Python code for the Java class you provided:
python
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums):
        if nums is None or len(nums) == 0:
            return []

        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n  # Initialize dp array with 1s
        previous = [-1] * n  # Initialize previous array with -1s

        max_length = 1
        last_index = 0

        # Calculate the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] >= nums[j] and dp[i] < dp[j] + 1:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    previous[i] = j

            # Update max_length and last_index
            if dp[i] > max_length:
                max_length = dp[i]
                last_index = i

        # Reconstruct the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        subsequence = []
        while last_index != -1:
            subsequence.insert(0, nums[last_index])  # Add to the beginning
            last_index = previous[last_index]

        return subsequence
Explanation of the Python Code:
Class Definition: We define a class Answer with a static method find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence.
Method Signature: The method takes a list of integers nums as input, similar to the Java method which takes an array.
Edge Case Handling: We check if nums is None or empty. If so, we return an empty list.
Initialization: We initialize two lists, dp and previous, similar to the Java code. In Python, list comprehension is used to initialize the dp and previous lists.
Finding the Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence:
The nested loop structure is retained, where we compare the current element with all previous elements.
If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element and the dp value can be increased, we update dp and previous.
Tracking Maximum Length and Last Index: We update max_length and last_index whenever we find a longer subsequence.
Reconstruction of the Subsequence: We build the result list subsequence by inserting elements at the beginning, ensuring the correct order.
Return Statement: Finally, we return the reconstructed subsequence.
Usage Example
Hereâ€™s how you could use the Answer class and the method:
python
nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 5]
longest_subsequence = Answer.find_longest_non_decreasing_subsequence(nums)
print(longest_subsequence)  # Output will be the longest non-decreasing subsequence
This Python code replicates the functionality of the original Java code while following Pythonic conventions.
