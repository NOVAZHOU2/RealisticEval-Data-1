Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function signature, including the conversion of comments and type annotations:

```typescript
/**
 * Find the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the given array.
 *
 * @param nums - The input array of integers.
 * @returns A list containing the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
 */
function findLongestNonDecreasingSubsequence(nums: number[]): number[] {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've preserved the original functionality and structure while converting the type annotations and comments to JSDoc format. The function signature is now adapted for TypeScript's type system.
