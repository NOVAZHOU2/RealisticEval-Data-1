Here's how you can write the equivalent TypeScript function signature for your Python code:

```typescript
/**
 * Logs an item by printing it. Handles strings, numbers, arrays, and objects by printing
 * them directly or as a JSON-formatted string. Other types are reported as errors.
 * @param {any} item - The item to be logged. Can be of any type.
 * @returns {any} - The item to be logged. Can be of any type.
 */
function log(item: any): any {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

### Explanation:
- **TypeScript Comments**: In TypeScript, we use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments that document the function.
- **Function Signature**:
  - `function log(item: any): any`: This declares a function named `log` that takes one parameter `item` of type `any` and returns a value of type `any`.
- **JSDoc Style**: Although not strictly necessary in TypeScript, using JSDoc style comments helps with documentation tools like TypeDoc and improves code readability for developers familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript.

This signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your original Python function while adhering to TypeScript syntax and conventions.
