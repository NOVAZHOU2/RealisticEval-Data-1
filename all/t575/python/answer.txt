Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code that replicates the functionality of the provided TypeScript function. The Python code formats the thread count into a user-friendly string just like the original TypeScript function.
python
def format_thread_count(count):
    """Formats the thread count into a user-friendly string.

    Args:
        count (int): The number of threads.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted string indicating the number of threads.
    """
    # Handle the case when there are no threads
    if count == 0:
        return "No Threads"
    
    # Convert the count to a string and pad it to ensure at least 2 digits
    thread_count = str(count).zfill(2)  # zfill pads the string with zeros
    
    # Determine the correct word form based on the count
    thread_word = "Thread" if count == 1 else "Threads"
    
    # Return the formatted string
    return f"{thread_count} {thread_word}"

# Example usage
print(format_thread_count(3))  # Output: "03 Threads"
print(format_thread_count(1))  # Output: "01 Thread"
print(format_thread_count(0))  # Output: "No Threads"
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition: The function format_thread_count takes an integer count as input.
Handling Zero Threads: It checks if the count is 0 and returns "No Threads".
String Conversion and Padding: The count is converted to a string using str(count) and padded to ensure it has at least two digits using zfill(2).
Determining the Word Form: It checks if the count is 1 to decide between "Thread" and "Threads".
Formatted String Return: The function constructs and returns the formatted string using an f-string.
Example Usage:
The provided example usage shows how to call the function and print the output for different thread counts.
