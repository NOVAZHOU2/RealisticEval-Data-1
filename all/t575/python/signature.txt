To convert the provided TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while keeping the comments, you can follow this structure. In Python, we typically use docstrings to describe functions. Here's how the conversion looks:
python
def format_thread_count(count: int) -> str:
    """
    Formats the thread count into a user-friendly string.
    For example:
        input: 3 output: 03 Threads
        input: 1 output: 01 Thread

    :param count: The number of threads.
    :return: A formatted string indicating the number of threads.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Name: The function name is converted from formatThreadCount to format_thread_count, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations:
count: int specifies that count should be an integer.
-> str indicates that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
The comment structure is changed to a docstring, which is the convention in Python for documenting functions.
The parameter and return type are described using :param and :return syntax.
Implementation Placeholder: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for where the implementation of the function would go.
