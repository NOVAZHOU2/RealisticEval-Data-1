Hereâ€™s the equivalent Catch2 test case in C++:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include "your_header_file.h" // Include the header file where formatThreadCount is declared

TEST_CASE("formatThreadCount", "[formatThreadCount]") {
    REQUIRE(formatThreadCount(1) == "01 Thread");
    REQUIRE(formatThreadCount(5) == "05 Threads");
    REQUIRE(formatThreadCount(10) == "10 Threads");
    REQUIRE(formatThreadCount(99) == "99 Threads");
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your_header_file.h"` with the actual header file name where the `formatThreadCount` function is declared. Let me know if you need anything else!
