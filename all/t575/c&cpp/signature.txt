Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Formats the thread count into a user-friendly string.
 * For example:
 *      input: 3 output: 03 Threads
 *      input: 1 output: 01 Thread
 *
 * @param count - The number of threads.
 * @returns A formatted string indicating the number of threads.
 */
std::string formatThreadCount(int count) {
}
```
