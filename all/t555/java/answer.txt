Here is the equivalent Java code for your Python function:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    public static double quaternionToAngle(double[] quaternion) {
        // Assuming quaternion[0] = w and quaternion[1, 2, 3] = x, y, z respectively.
        double w = quaternion[0];
        double x = quaternion[1];
        double y = quaternion[2];
        double z = quaternion[3];

        return 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z), w);
    }
}
```

This Java method `quaternionToAngle` takes an array of doubles representing the quaternion components and returns the rotation angle in radians. Note that the conversion formula used here is based on the assumption that the quaternion is in the form (w, x, y, z). If your quaternion format is different, you'll need to adjust the calculation accordingly.
