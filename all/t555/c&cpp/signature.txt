Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the provided Python function, keeping the same comments:

```cpp
#include <tuple>
#include <cmath>

/**
 * Converts a quaternion to a rotation angle in radians.
 *
 * @param quaternion A tuple or list containing the quaternion components (w, x, y, z)
 * @return The rotation angle in radians
 */
double quaternionToAngle(const std::tuple<double, double, double, double>& quaternion);
```

### Explanation:
- `#include <tuple>` and `#include <cmath>` include necessary headers for using tuples and mathematical functions like `std::sqrt` and `std::acos`.
- The function `quaternionToAngle` takes a constant reference to a tuple of four doubles representing the quaternion components `(w, x, y, z)`.
- The return type is `double`, which corresponds to the floating-point number type used in the original Python function.

This C++ signature can be further implemented with the actual conversion logic inside the function body.
