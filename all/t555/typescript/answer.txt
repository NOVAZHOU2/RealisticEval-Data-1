Here is your Python code translated into TypeScript:

```typescript
type Quaternion = [number, number, number, number];

function quaternionToAngle(quaternion: Quaternion): number {
    /**
     * Converts a quaternion to a rotation angle in radians.
     *
     * @param {Quaternion} quaternion - A tuple or array containing the quaternion components (w, x, y, z)
     * @returns {number} - The rotation angle in radians
     */
    return Math.acos(2 * quaternion[0] * quaternion[0] - 1);
}
```

Please note that this function assumes you're using a unit quaternion (i.e., the sum of squares of its components equals 1). If your quaternions are not unit quaternions, you will need to normalize them before passing them to this function.
