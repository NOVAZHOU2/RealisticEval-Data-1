Sure, here is the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a quaternion to a rotation angle in radians.
 *
 * @param {Array} quaternion - An array containing the quaternion components [w, x, y, z]
 * @returns {number} The rotation angle in radians
 */
function quaternionToAngle(quaternion) {
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments for documentation. The `@param` tag is used to describe the function parameters, and the `@returns` tag is used to describe what the function returns. Note that JavaScript arrays are passed by reference, so you don't need to specify the type of each element inside the array.
