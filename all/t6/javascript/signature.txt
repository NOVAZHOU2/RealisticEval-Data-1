Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Simplify file paths in Windows systems into name strings.
 * For example:
 *     input: C:\\Users\\User\\file.txt
 *     output: C_Users_User_file.txt
 * @param {string} path - The windows file path string
 * @returns {string} - Simplified path string
 */
function simplifyWindowsPath(path) {
    // ...
}
```

In JavaScript, we use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single-line comments. We also don't have explicit type declarations like in Python, so we just list the parameter names. The return type isn't specified in the comment because JavaScript is dynamically typed.

The actual implementation of the function would go inside the `simplifyWindowsPath` function body.
