Here is the Java code signature equivalent to your Python function:

```java
/**
 * Simplify file paths in Windows systems into name strings.
 * 
 * Example:
 *      Input: C:\\Users\\User\\file.txt
 *      Output: C_Users_User_file.txt
 *      
 * @param path The Windows file path string.
 * @return The simplified path string.
 */
public static String simplifyWindowsPath(String path) {
```

This Java method has the same functionality and purpose as your Python function. It takes a string representing a Windows file path as an argument and returns a simplified version of that path. The `@param` and `@return` tags are used for documentation purposes, similar to the Python docstrings you provided.
