Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Simplify file paths in Windows systems into name strings.
 * For example:
 *     input: C:\\Users\\User\\file.txt
 *     output: C_Users_User_file.txt
 *
 * @param path The Windows file path string.
 * @return The simplified path string.
 */
std::string simplify_windows_path(const std::string& path);
```

This C++ function takes a `const std::string&` as an argument and returns a `std::string`. The docstring is preserved to describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
