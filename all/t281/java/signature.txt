Sure, here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Compute the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors.
 *
 * @param vec1 the first vector
 * @param vec2 the second vector
 * @return the squared Euclidean distance between vec1 and vec2
 */
public static int squaredEuclideanDistance(List<Integer> vec1, List<Integer> vec2) {
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your original Python function.
