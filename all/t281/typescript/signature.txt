Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Computes the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors.
 * 
 * @param vec1 - The first vector as an array of integers.
 * @param vec2 - The second vector as an array of integers.
 * @returns The squared Euclidean distance between vec1 and vec2 as an integer.
 */
function squaredEuclideanDistance(vec1: number[], vec2: number[]): number {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `number[]` instead of `List[int]` to represent arrays of numbers. The function signature and documentation comments have been adjusted accordingly. You'll need to implement the logic inside the function based on your requirements.
