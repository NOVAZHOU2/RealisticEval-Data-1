Here is your Python code converted to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Compute the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors.
 *
 * @param {number[]} vec1 - The first vector.
 * @param {number[]} vec2 - The second vector.
 * @returns {number} - The Euclidean distance between vec1 and vec2.
 */
function squaredEuclideanDistance(vec1: number[], vec2: number[]): number {
```

Please note that in TypeScript, you don't have to explicitly declare the return type of the function if it can be inferred from its body. However, I've included it here for consistency with the Python code.
