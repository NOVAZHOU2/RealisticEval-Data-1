Sure! Below is the equivalent test class implemented in C++ using the Catch2 testing framework. This includes the definition of the `squared_euclidean_distance` function and the corresponding test cases.

First, ensure you have the Catch2 library included in your project. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) or install it via your package manager.

Here is the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to compute the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors
int squared_euclidean_distance(const std::vector<int>& vec1, const std::vector<int>& vec2) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec1.size(); ++i) {
        sum += std::pow(vec1[i] - vec2[i], 2);
    }
    return sum;
}

TEST_CASE("Squared Euclidean Distance Tests") {
    // Test case 1: Both vectors are empty
    SECTION("Both vectors are empty") {
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({}, {}) == 0);
    }

    // Test case 2: One vector is empty
    SECTION("One vector is empty") {
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({1, 2, 3}, {}) == 14); // Assuming the other vector is implicitly treated as zeros
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({}, {1, 2, 3}) == 14); // Assuming the other vector is implicitly treated as zeros
    }

    // Test case 3: Both vectors are equal
    SECTION("Both vectors are equal") {
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}) == 0);
    }

    // Test case 4: Different vectors with the same length
    SECTION("Different vectors with the same length") {
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}) == 27);
    }

    // Test case 5: Vectors of different lengths
    SECTION("Vectors of different lengths") {
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}) == 20); // Assuming shorter vector is extended with zeros
        REQUIRE(squared_euclidean_distance({1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}) == 18); // Assuming shorter vector is extended with zeros
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The `squared_euclidean_distance` function computes the squared Euclidean distance between two integer vectors.
- **Test Class**: The `TEST_CASE` macro is used to define a test case named "Squared Euclidean Distance Tests".
- **Sections**: Each `SECTION` within the test case defines a specific scenario to be tested, such as both vectors being empty, one vector being empty, both vectors being equal, etc.
- **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to assert the expected results of each test scenario.

This setup ensures that the functionality and logic of the original Python unittest are preserved while adapting to the C++ environment and using Catch2 assertions.
