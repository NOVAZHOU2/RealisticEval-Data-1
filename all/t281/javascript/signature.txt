Here is your Python function converted into JavaScript with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Compute the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} vec1 - The first vector.
 * @param {Array<number>} vec2 - The second vector.
 * @returns {number} The Euclidean distance between vec1 and vec2.
 */
function squaredEuclideanDistance(vec1, vec2) {
  // ...
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, arrays are used instead of lists, and the type annotations are not enforced like in Python.
