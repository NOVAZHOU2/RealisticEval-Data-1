Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Compute the squared Euclidean distance between two vectors.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} vec1 - The first vector.
 * @param {number[]} vec2 - The second vector.
 * 
 * @returns {number} The squared Euclidean distance between vec1 and vec2.
 */
function squaredEuclideanDistance(vec1, vec2) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

Note that in the actual implementation of `squaredEuclideanDistance`, you would write the logic to calculate the squared Euclidean distance. The JSDoc comments provide information about the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, which is analogous to the Python docstring you provided.
