Here’s the conversion of the provided C++ code signature to a Python code signature, keeping the comments and converting them to Python-style comments.
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def hex_string_to_unsigned_int(hex_string: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert a hexadecimal string representing an unsigned integer to its corresponding unsigned integer value.

    :param hex_string: The hexadecimal string to be converted.
    :return: The unsigned integer value represented by the hexadecimal string.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Changes:
Function Name:
The function name is changed from hexStringToUnsignedInt to hex_string_to_unsigned_int to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
Parameter and Return Types:
The parameter hex_string retains its name and type is specified as str. The return type is specified as int.
Comment Conversion:
The C++ style comments are converted to Python docstrings using triple quotes """.
The formatting is kept clear and structured to explain the function’s purpose, parameters, and return value.
Function Body:
The function body is defined with pass, indicating that the implementation will be added later.
Usage:
You can use this function signature in your Python code and later implement the logic for converting a hexadecimal string to an unsigned integer as needed.
