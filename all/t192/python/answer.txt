Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function that converts a hexadecimal string to an unsigned integer:
Converted Python Code
python
def hex_string_to_unsigned_int(hex_string: str) -> int:
    """
    Converts a hexadecimal string to an unsigned integer.

    :param hex_string: The hexadecimal string to be converted.
    :return: An unsigned integer representation of the hexadecimal string.
    """
    return int(hex_string, 16)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hex_input = "1a3f"  # Example hex string
    result = hex_string_to_unsigned_int(hex_input)
    print(f"The unsigned integer value of the hex string '{hex_input}' is {result}.")
Explanation of the Code:
Function Definition:
The function hex_string_to_unsigned_int is defined to take a string input (hex_string).
Conversion Logic:
The conversion from hexadecimal string to integer is done using Python's built-in int() function, specifying 16 as the base. This is simpler than using streams in C++.
Return Value:
The function returns the integer value, which is equivalent to an unsigned integer in C++.
Example Usage:
An example usage is provided in the if __name__ == "__main__": block, allowing you to test the function directly by running the script.
Running the Code:
You can save this code in a file named hex_to_unsigned_int.py and run it with:
bash
python hex_to_unsigned_int.py
This will execute the function and print the result for the provided example hexadecimal string. You can change the hex_input variable to test different hexadecimal strings as needed.
