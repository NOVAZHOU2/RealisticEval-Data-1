Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method signature, including the converted comments in Javadoc format:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the day of the week for a given date.
 *
 * @param year The year of the date (e.g., 2024).
 * @param month The month of the date (1 = January, 2 = February, ..., 12 = December).
 * @param day The day of the month (1 to 31, depending on the month).
 * 
 * @return An integer representing the day of the week:
 *         - 1 for Monday
 *         - 2 for Tuesday
 *         - 3 for Wednesday
 *         - 4 for Thursday
 *         - 5 for Friday
 *         - 6 for Saturday
 *         - 7 for Sunday
 */
public static int dayOfWeek(int year, int month, int day) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The C++ comments have been transformed into Javadoc comments, using `/** */`.
- The function name is converted to camelCase (`dayOfWeek`).
- The return type and parameter types are declared using Java syntax.
- The `public static` modifiers are added, following Java conventions for method visibility and static context.
