Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided C++ Catch2 test cases into equivalent test cases using TypeScript's Jest framework:

```typescript
import { dayOfWeek } from './path/to/your/module'; // Adjust the import according to your file structure

describe('Day of Week Calculation', () => {
    test('January 1, 2024 is a Monday', () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2024, 1, 1)).toBe(1);
    });

    test('August 29, 2023 is a Tuesday', () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2023, 8, 29)).toBe(2);
    });

    test('December 25, 2022 is a Sunday', () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2022, 12, 25)).toBe(7);
    });

    test('November 9, 1989 is a Thursday', () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(1989, 11, 9)).toBe(4);
    });

    test('February 29, 2000 is a Tuesday', () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2000, 2, 29)).toBe(2);
    });
});
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Imports**: Adjust the import statement based on your project's structure to access the `dayOfWeek` function.
- **Testing Structure**: Used `describe` and `test` functions to structure the tests, which is common in Jest.
- **Assertions**: Replaced `REQUIRE` with `expect(...).toBe(...)` for assertions.
