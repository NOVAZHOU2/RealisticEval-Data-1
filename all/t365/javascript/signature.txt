Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted into its equivalent JavaScript version, along with the comments adapted accordingly:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the day of the week for a given date.
 *
 * @param {number} year The year of the date (e.g., 2024).
 * @param {number} month The month of the date (1 = January, 2 = February, ..., 12 = December).
 * @param {number} day The day of the month (1 to 31, depending on the month).
 * 
 * @return {number} An integer representing the day of the week:
 *         - 1 for Monday
 *         - 2 for Tuesday
 *         - 3 for Wednesday
 *         - 4 for Thursday
 *         - 5 for Friday
 *         - 6 for Saturday
 *         - 7 for Sunday
 */
function dayOfWeek(year, month, day) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: Changed `int day_of_week(int year, int month, int day)` to `function dayOfWeek(year, month, day)`.
2. **Type Declarations**: JavaScript does not require type declarations, but I've included JSDoc annotations for parameter types and return type to maintain clarity.
3. **Comment Style**: Converted C++ comments to JavaScript-style comments using `/** ... */` for multi-line comments.
