Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided C++ Catch2 test cases into equivalent test cases using JavaScript's Jest framework. The logic and functionality will remain consistent, and the assertions will be adapted accordingly.

### Converted Jest Test Cases:

```javascript
// dayOfWeek.js
function dayOfWeek(year, month, day) {
    const t = [0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4];
    if (month < 3) {
        year -= 1;
    }
    const result = (year + Math.floor(year / 4) - Math.floor(year / 100) + Math.floor(year / 400) + t[month - 1] + day) % 7;
    return (result === 0) ? 7 : (result % 7); // Adjusted to correctly map Sunday as 7
}

module.exports = dayOfWeek;

// dayOfWeek.test.js
const dayOfWeek = require('./dayOfWeek');

describe("Day of Week Calculation", () => {
    test("January 1, 2024 is a Monday", () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2024, 1, 1)).toBe(1);
    });

    test("August 29, 2023 is a Tuesday", () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2023, 8, 29)).toBe(2);
    });

    test("December 25, 2022 is a Sunday", () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2022, 12, 25)).toBe(7);
    });

    test("November 9, 1989 is a Thursday", () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(1989, 11, 9)).toBe(4);
    });

    test("February 29, 2000 is a Tuesday", () => {
        expect(dayOfWeek(2000, 2, 29)).toBe(2);
    });
});
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Test Structure**: Converted from `TEST_CASE` and `REQUIRE` to Jest's `describe` and `test` functions with `expect` for assertions.
2. **Function Import**: The `dayOfWeek` function is imported at the beginning of the test file.
3. **Test Descriptions**: Each test description is adjusted to match the Jest syntax.

You can run these tests using Jest, and they will verify the functionality of the `dayOfWeek` function just like the original C++ tests. Let me know if you need anything else!
