Sure! Below is the TypeScript code signature you provided, converted into Python code signature while retaining the comments.
python
def compress_filename(file_name: str, max_length: int = 18) -> str:
    """
    Compresses long filenames to the specified maximum length by inserting an ellipsis in the middle while preserving the filename extension, which defaults to 18 characters.
    
    For example:
        compress_filename('verylongfilename.txt', 10) output: verylongfi***.txt
    
    Args:
        file_name (str): The original file name to be compressed.
        max_length (int): The maximum allowed length for the compressed file name. Defaults to 18.
    
    Returns:
        str: The compressed file name, with the middle section replaced by ellipses ('...'), 
              or the original file name if it is within the maximum length.
    """
Key Changes:
Function Naming Convention: Changed compressFileName to compress_filename to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations: Used Python's type hinting with str and int for parameters and return type.
Docstring Format: Adapted the JSDoc style comments to Python's docstring format using triple quotes (""").
