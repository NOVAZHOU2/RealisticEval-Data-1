Hereâ€™s the JavaScript version of the function signature with comments preserved:

```javascript
/**
 * Compresses long filenames to the specified maximum length by inserting an ellipsis in the middle while preserving the filename extension, which defaults to 18 characters
 * For example:
 *      compressFilename('verylongfilename.txt', 10) output: verylongfi***.txt
 *
 * @param {string} fileName - The original file name to be compressed.
 * @param {number} maxLength - The maximum allowed length for the compressed file name. Defaults to 18.
 * @returns {string} The compressed file name, with the middle section replaced by ellipses ('...'), or the original file name if it is within the maximum length.
 */
function compressFileName(fileName, maxLength = 18) {
}
```

This keeps the comments intact while removing the TypeScript-specific type annotations.
