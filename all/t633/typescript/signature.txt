Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided Python function signature, with appropriate documentation comments and type annotations:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads a CSV file and parses each line into a list of strings.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the CSV file.
 * @returns A list of string arrays, where each array represents a line from the CSV.
 */
function readCsv(filePath: string): Promise<string[][]> {
    // Function implementation would go here
}
```

### Key Changes Explained:

1. **Function Name**: The function name is converted to camelCase (`readCsv`), which is the common convention in TypeScript.

2. **Parameter and Return Types**:
   - The parameter `file_path` is changed to `filePath` to follow camelCase naming conventions.
   - The return type `List[List[str]]` from Python is converted to `Promise<string[][]>`, indicating that the function returns a promise that resolves to a 2D array of strings.

3. **Documentation Comments**: The Python docstring is converted into JSDoc style comments, using `/** ... */` format, to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.

Feel free to expand the implementation as needed!
