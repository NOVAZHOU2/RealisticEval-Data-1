Here's the equivalent C++ function signature along with comments that capture the purpose and structure of the original Python function. The C++ type annotations and documentation standards are applied accordingly:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * @brief Reads a CSV file and parses each line into a vector of strings.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the CSV file.
 * @return A vector of vector of strings, where each vector represents a line from the CSV.
 */
std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> read_csv(const std::string& file_path);
```

### Key Adaptations:
1. **Function Signature**: The return type is `std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>`, which corresponds to `List[List[str]]` in Python.
2. **Parameter Types**: The parameter is defined as `const std::string& file_path`, matching `file_path: str`.
3. **Documentation Comments**: The Python docstring is translated into a C++ comment block using `/** ... */`, with appropriate tags like `@brief`, `@param`, and `@return`.
4. **Header Inclusion**: Necessary headers (`<vector>` and `<string>`) are included to support the used types.

This C++ signature effectively mirrors the original Python function while conforming to C++ conventions.
