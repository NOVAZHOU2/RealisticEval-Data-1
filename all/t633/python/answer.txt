Here is the equivalent Python code that replicates the functionality of the provided Java class. The Python code reads a CSV file, parses its content into a list of lists (similar to the Java implementation), and includes an equivalent main function to demonstrate its usage.
python
import csv
from typing import List

class Answer:
    def read_csv(self, file_path: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        """
        Reads a CSV file and parses each line into a list of strings.

        :param file_path: The path to the CSV file.
        :return: A list of string lists, where each list represents a line from the CSV.
        """
        csv_data = []
        # Read the CSV file
        with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            # Parse each line into a list of strings
            for row in reader:
                csv_data.append(row)
        return csv_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    answer = Answer()
    path_to_csv = "path/to/your/file.csv"  # Change to your CSV file path
    try:
        result = answer.read_csv(path_to_csv)
        # Print the result for demonstration
        for row in result:
            print(row)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
Key Differences Explained
Imports:
In Python, we import the csv module to handle CSV file reading. The List type from typing is used for type hints.
Method Definition:
The method read_csv in Python uses def and does not need to specify an exception in the signature since Python handles exceptions differently from Java.
File Reading:
We use a with statement to open the file, ensuring it is properly closed after reading. The csv.reader function is used to read the CSV file, which automatically splits the rows by commas.
Error Handling:
Python uses a general Exception for error handling, which is captured in the except block. You can specify a more specific exception if needed.
Printing Results:
The output format remains similar, and it iterates over the result to print each row.
This code should function identically to your Java implementation while following Pythonic conventions. You can replace "path/to/your/file.csv" with the actual path of your CSV file for testing.
