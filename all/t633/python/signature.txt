To convert the provided Java function signature into a Python function signature, we need to consider several differences between the two languages:
Return Type: In Java, the return type is specified before the function name, while in Python, it is specified using a type hint after the parameters.
Exception Handling: Python typically uses exceptions directly without declaring them in the function signature.
Parameter Types: In Java, parameter types are specified, while in Python, you can use type hints.
List Structure: In the Java code, a list of string arrays (List<List<String>>) translates to a list of lists of strings in Python (List[List[str]]).
Here's how the Java function signature would be converted into Python:
Java Signature:
java
public List<List<String>> readCsv(String filePath) throws IOException {}
Python Signature:
python
from typing import List

def read_csv(file_path: str) -> List[List[str]]:
Explanation:
Function Name: Changed to snake_case (read_csv) to follow Python naming conventions.
Parameter: filePath is changed to file_path to follow Python's snake_case style.
Return Type: Specified as List[List[str]] to indicate that the function returns a list of lists of strings.
No Exception Declaration: In Python, you donâ€™t specify exceptions in the function signature.
Complete Example in Python:
If you wanted to implement this function in Python, it might look something like this:
python
from typing import List
import csv

def read_csv(file_path: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Reads a CSV file and parses each line into a list of strings.
    
    :param file_path: The path to the CSV file.
    :return: A list of lists of strings, where each list represents a line from the CSV.
    """
    with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        return [row for row in reader]
Key Points:
This Python function uses the csv module to read the CSV file, which is a common approach in Python.
The function reads each row of the CSV file and returns a list of lists of strings.
