Here's the equivalent JavaScript function signature and comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a CSV file and parses each line into a list of strings.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the CSV file.
 * @returns {Array<Array<string>>} A list of string lists, where each list represents a line from the CSV.
 */
async function readCsv(filePath) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This conversion maintains the structure and purpose of the original code. Would you like to explore any specific details further?
