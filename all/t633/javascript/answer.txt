To convert the provided Python code into JavaScript, here's the equivalent code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');

async function readCsv(filePath) {
    const csvData = [];
    const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);

    const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: fileStream,
        crlfDelay: Infinity
    });

    for await (const line of rl) {
        csvData.push(line.split(','));
    }
    
    return csvData;
}
```

This JavaScript code maintains the functionality and logic of the original Python code. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific part?
