Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/* 
 * Converts a hexadecimal string into a byte array. 
 * Hexadecimal strings are often used to represent binary data
 * in a readable format, especially in networking, cryptography, and systems programming.
 * 
 * Args:
 *     hex_str (std::string): The hexadecimal string to be converted. This string should only contain 
 *     hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F, a-f). If the string has an odd number of characters, a leading 
 *     zero is added to ensure proper conversion.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *     std::vector<uint8_t>: A byte array representing the binary data encoded in the hex string.
 */
std::vector<uint8_t> hex_string_to_byte_array(const std::string& hex_str);
```

This maintains the purpose and structure while adapting to C++ standards.
