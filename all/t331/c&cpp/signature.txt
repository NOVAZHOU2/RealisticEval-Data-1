Here's the C++ code signature that mirrors your TypeScript function signature while keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <sstream>

/**
 * Calculates the final price after applying a discount to the original price.
 * Both price and discount are expected as strings and should represent valid numbers.
 * The discount should be a percentage value between 0 and 100.
 *
 * @param price The original price as a string.
 * @param discount The discount percentage as a string.
 * @returns The final price after applying the discount, rounded to two decimal places.
 * @throws Will throw an error if price or discount aren't valid numbers or if the discount is out of the expected range.
 */
double calculateFinalPrice(const std::string& price, const std::string& discount) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This signature maintains the same structure and documentation style as your TypeScript function while adapting to C++ syntax. You can implement the function logic inside the curly braces as needed.
