Here’s how to convert the provided TypeScript code to Python, maintaining the functionality and comments:
python
def calculate_final_price(price: str, discount: str) -> float:
    """ 
    Calculates the final price after applying a discount to the original price. 
    Both price and discount are expected as strings and should represent valid numbers. 
    The discount should be a percentage value between 0 and 100.

    Args:
        price (str): The original price as a string.
        discount (str): The discount percentage as a string.

    Returns:
        float: The final price after applying the discount, rounded to two decimal places.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If price or discount aren't valid numbers or if the discount is out of the expected range.
    """
    try:
        price_value = float(price)
        discount_value = float(discount)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError('Invalid price or discount value.')

    if discount_value < 0 or discount_value > 100:
        raise ValueError('Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100.')

    discount_amount = price_value * discount_value / 100
    final_price = price_value - discount_amount

    return round(final_price, 2)

# Example usage:
# final_price = calculate_final_price("100", "15")
# print(final_price)  # Output: 85.0
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition:
The function is defined as calculate_final_price, using snake_case for the name, which is standard in Python.
Docstring:
The comments are converted into a docstring that explains the function’s purpose, arguments, return value, and exceptions raised.
Input Handling:
The try-except block attempts to convert the price and discount from strings to floats. If conversion fails (i.e., the input strings are not valid numbers), a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.
Range Checking:
It checks if the discount is within the valid range (0 to 100). If it is not, it raises a ValueError with a corresponding message.
Calculating the Discount:
The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage divided by 100.
Final Price Calculation:
The final price is computed by subtracting the discount amount from the original price.
Rounding:
The final price is rounded to two decimal places using Python’s built-in round() function.
Example Usage:
You can uncomment the example usage code to test the function directly. This will allow you to see how the function works when provided with sample input values.
