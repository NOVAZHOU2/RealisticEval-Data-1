Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java method signature for the given Python function, including the comments:

```java
/**
 * Saves the provided content to a specified file after cleaning up redundant whitespace.
 *
 * @param content The text content to be saved to the file.
 * @param path The file path where the content will be saved.
 */
public static void saveContentToFile(String content, String path) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same structure and includes Javadoc comments to describe the method's purpose, parameters, and return type.
