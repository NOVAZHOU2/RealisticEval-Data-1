Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code for the given Python function. The package and class names have been changed as per your requirements:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    /**
     * Saves the provided content to a specified file after cleaning up
     * redundant whitespace.
     *
     * @param content The text content to be saved to the file.
     * @param path The file path where the content will be saved.
     */
    public static void saveContentToFile(String content, String path) {
        // Implement the logic to save content to file here
        // For example, using BufferedWriter to write the content to the file
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(path))) {
            writer.write(content.replaceAll("\\s+", " "));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of the method
        String content = "This   is  a   test   string.";
        String path = "output.txt";
        saveContentToFile(content, path);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The `package` declaration specifies the package name `org.real.temp`.
2. **Class Declaration**: The `class` declaration defines a public class named `Answer`.
3. **Method Declaration**: The `saveContentToFile` method is declared as `static` so it can be called without creating an instance of the class. It takes two parameters: `content` (a `String`) and `path` (a `String`), and returns `void`.
4. **File Writing Logic**: Inside the method, we use a `try-with-resources` block to create a `BufferedWriter` that writes to the specified file path. The `replaceAll("\\s+", " ")` method is used to clean up redundant whitespace in the content before writing it to the file.
5. **Exception Handling**: We handle `IOException` that might occur during file operations.
6. **Example Usage**: A `main` method is included to demonstrate how to call the `saveContentToFile` method with sample data.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the specified file path.
