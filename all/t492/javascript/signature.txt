Sure, here is the JavaScript code signature with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Saves the provided content to a specified file after cleaning up
 * redundant whitespace.
 *
 * @param {string} content - The text content to be saved to the file.
 * @param {string} path - The file path where the content will be saved.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function saveContentToFile(content, path) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function `saveContentToFile` takes two parameters: `content` and `path`, both of which are strings. It returns `undefined` (which is represented as `void` in TypeScript/JavaScript documentation).
