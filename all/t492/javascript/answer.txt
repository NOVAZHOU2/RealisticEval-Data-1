Here is how you can write the same function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function saveContentToFile(content, path) {
    /**
     * Saves the provided content to a specified file after cleaning up
     * redundant whitespace.
     *
     * @param {string} content - The text content to be saved to the file.
     * @param {string} path - The file path where the content will be saved.
     */

    // Clean up redundant whitespace
    let cleanedContent = content.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();

    // Write the cleaned content to the file
    fs.writeFileSync(path, cleanedContent);
}
```

Please note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for saving files like Python does with `open()` and `write()`. Therefore, we need to use an external library such as `fs` (File System). If you don't have it installed, you can install it using npm (`npm install fs`). 

Also, make sure to handle any potential errors that might occur when trying to write to a file. This could include permissions issues or the file being read-only.
