To convert the given C++ code signature to a Python code signature while keeping the comments and converting them to Python style, you can follow this format:
Change the function declaration to Python's syntax.
Use Python's comment syntax (#) for comments.
Remove type specifiers since Python is dynamically typed.
Here's how the C++ code looks after being converted to Python:
python
def get_days_in_month(year, month):
    """ 
    Returns the number of days in a given month of a given year.
    
    This function accounts for leap years when determining the number of 
    days in February. It raises a ValueError if the month is invalid.
    
    Args:
        year: The year to check (should be a positive integer).
        month: The month to check (1 for January, 12 for December).
        
    Returns:
        int: The number of days in the specified month of the specified year.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the month is not between 1 and 12.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Key Changes:
Function Name: Changed from getDaysInMonth to get_days_in_month to follow Python's naming conventions.
Comments: Converted C++ style comments (/** ... */) to Python docstring format and single-line comments to # format.
Return Type and Exception Handling: Changed throws std::invalid_argument to a Pythonic way of raising a ValueError in the comments.
Body Placeholder: Used pass in Python as a placeholder for the function implementation.
