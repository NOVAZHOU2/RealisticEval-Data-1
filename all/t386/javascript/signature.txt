Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * This function converts the encoding of a file from one encoding to another
 *
 * @param {string} inputFilePath - The path to the input file.
 * @param {string} outputFilePath - The path to the output file where the converted content is saved.
 * @param {string} [originalEncoding='cp932'] - The original encoding of the file (default is cp932).
 * @param {string} [targetEncoding='utf-16'] - The target encoding to convert to (default is utf_16).
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - A Promise that resolves with true if the conversion was successful, or if no conversion was needed; false otherwise.
 */
async function convertEncoding(inputFilePath, outputFilePath, originalEncoding = 'cp932', targetEncoding = 'utf-16') {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, we use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations and Promises to handle asynchronous results. Also, JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for changing file encodings like Python does, so you would need to use an external library or approach to achieve this functionality.
