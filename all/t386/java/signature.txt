Sure, here is the Java code signature with similar comments:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class EncodingConverter {
    /**
     * This method converts the encoding of a file from one encoding to another.
     *
     * @param inputFilePath      The path to the input file.
     * @param outputFilePath     The path to the output file where the converted content is saved.
     * @param originalEncoding   The original encoding of the file (default is "cp932").
     * @param targetEncoding     The target encoding to convert to (default is "UTF-16").
     * @return                   true if the conversion was successful, or if no conversion was needed; false otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean convertEncoding(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath, String originalEncoding, String targetEncoding) throws IOException {
```

Please note that in Java, exceptions need to be handled explicitly, and the return type should match the expected result. If you want to handle exceptions directly within the method, you can add `throws IOException` to the method signature.
