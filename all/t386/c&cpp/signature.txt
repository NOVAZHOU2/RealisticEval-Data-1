```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

/**
 * Converts the encoding of a file from one encoding to another.
 *
 * @param input_file_path The path to the input file.
 * @param output_file_path The path to the output file where the converted content is saved.
 * @param original_encoding The original encoding of the file (default is "cp932").
 * @param target_encoding The target encoding to convert to (default is "utf-16").
 * @return true if the conversion was successful or if no conversion was needed; false otherwise.
 */
bool convertEncoding(const std::string& inputFilePath, const std::string& outputFilePath,
                    const std::string& originalEncoding = "cp932", 
                    const std::string& targetEncoding = "utf-16") {
    // Implementation here
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation for converting encodings in C++ would be significantly more complex than what can be done with Python's `shutil` module. In C++, you might need to use external libraries such as iconv or ICU for character set conversion.
