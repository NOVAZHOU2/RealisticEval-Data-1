Here's the C++ code signature with comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Checks whether a file name is a C++ header file.
 *
 * @param fileName - The name of the file to check.
 * @returns true if the file is a C++ header file, false otherwise.
 */
bool isCppHeaderFile(const std::string& fileName) {
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from your original JavaScript code while adapting it to C++.
