Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to Python while keeping the comments:

```python
# Checks whether a file name is a C++ header file.
#
# @param fileName: The name of the file to check.
# @type fileName: str
# @return: Returns True if the file is a C++ header file, False otherwise.
# @rtype: bool
def is_cpp_header_file(file_name):
    pass
```

In Python, we don't have an exact equivalent to JavaScript's JSDoc style comments for function parameters and return types. However, we can use docstrings to achieve a similar purpose. The above comment block uses a triple-quote string (`"""`) to document the function, including its description, parameter types, and return type. This makes it easier for other developers (or future you) to understand what the function does and how to use it.
