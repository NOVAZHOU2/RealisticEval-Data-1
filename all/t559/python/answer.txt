Here's the equivalent Python code for your JavaScript function:

```python
def is_cpp_header_file(file_name):
    """
    Checks whether a file name is a C++ header file.

    :param str file_name: The name of the file to check.
    :return: True if the file is a C++ header file, False otherwise.
    :rtype: bool
    """
    # Add your implementation here
    pass
```

Please note that I've left the implementation of the `is_cpp_header_file` function empty, just like in your original JavaScript code. You'll need to add your own logic inside the function to determine whether the given file name is a C++ header file.
