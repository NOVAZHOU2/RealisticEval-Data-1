Here's the Java code signature with the comments preserved, adapted from your JavaScript version:

```java
/**
 * Checks whether a file name is a C++ header file.
 *
 * @param fileName - The name of the file to check.
 * @returns - Returns true if the file is a C++ header file, false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean isCppHeaderFile(String fileName) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the same structure and comments as your original JavaScript code signature. Let me know if you need anything else!
