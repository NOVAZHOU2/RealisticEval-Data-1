Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java method signature with comments:

```java
/**
 * Checks whether a file name is a C++ header file.
 *
 * @param fileName The name of the file to check.
 * @return true if the file is a C++ header file, false otherwise.
 */
public boolean isCppHeaderFile(String fileName) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and purpose as your original JavaScript function, including the comment that describes what the method does.
