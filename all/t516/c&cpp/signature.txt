/**

 * @param file_path The path to the YAML file.
 * @return A boost::variant containing either a std::map<std::string, boost::any> for dictionaries or a std::vector<boost::any> for lists.
 * @throw std::runtime_error if the specified file does not exist or if there is an error parsing the YAML file.

boost::variant<std::map<std::string, boost::any>, std::vector<boost::any>> read_yaml(const std::string& file_path) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Please note that in C++, you would typically use a library like Boost.Serialization or YAML-CPP to parse YAML files into C++ data structures. The `boost::variant` type is used here to return either a dictionary (`std::map<std::string, boost::any>`) or a list (`std::vector<boost::any>`). Make sure to include the appropriate headers and link against the necessary libraries when compiling your C++ code.
