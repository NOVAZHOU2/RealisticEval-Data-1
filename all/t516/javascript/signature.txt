Sure, here's the JavaScript code signature with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a YAML file and returns its content as a JavaScript object or array.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the YAML file.
 * @returns {Object|Array} Parsed YAML content as a JavaScript data structure.
 * @throws {Error} If the specified file does not exist or if there is an error parsing the YAML file.
 */
```

This JavaScript function signature uses JSDoc style comments to describe the function parameters, return type, and any potential exceptions that can be thrown.
