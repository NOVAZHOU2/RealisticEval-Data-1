Here's the C++ code signature with comments retained:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth
 * using their latitude and longitude based on the Haversine formula.
 *
 * @param lat1 - Latitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lon1 - Longitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lat2 - Latitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @param lon2 - Longitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @returns The distance between the two points in kilometers.
 */
double calculateDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {

}
```
