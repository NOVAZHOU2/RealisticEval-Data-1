Here's the Java method signature with comments preserved from the JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth
 * using their latitude and longitude based on the Haversine formula.
 *
 * @param lat1 Latitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lon1 Longitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lat2 Latitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @param lon2 Longitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @return The distance between the two points in kilometers.
 */
public static double calculateDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The method is declared as `public static` to allow access without needing an instance of the class.
- The parameters are of type `double`, matching the number type used in JavaScript.
- The return type is also `double`, which corresponds to the `number` type in JavaScript.
