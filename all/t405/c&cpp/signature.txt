Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/**
 * Removes the part before the first uppercase letter and the first lowercase letter from each string.
 *
 * Example:
 *     Input: "1234AbCde5678"
 *     Output: "AbCde5678"
 *
 * @param strings A vector of strings to be processed.
 * @return A vector of strings after processing.
 */
std::vector<std::string> removePartsOfString(const std::vector<std::string>& strings);
```

This C++ function takes a vector of strings as an argument and returns a vector of strings after processing. The comments explain the purpose and behavior of the function.
