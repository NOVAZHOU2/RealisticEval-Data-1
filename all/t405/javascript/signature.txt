Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Remove the part before the first upper case letter and the first lower case letter from the string.
 *
 * For example:
 *     input: 1234AbCde5678
 *     output: AbCde5678
 *
 * @param {...string} strings - Accepts one or more strings as variable arguments.
 */
function removePartsOfString(...strings) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In JavaScript, you would typically define the function body within the `removePartsOfString` function, depending on how you intend to implement the logic for removing parts of the string based on the given conditions.
