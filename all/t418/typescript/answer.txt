Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
    /**
     * Give you an integer array nums and find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
     * For example:
     *      input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
     *      output: 4
     *
     * @param {number[]} nums - integer array
     * @returns {number} - the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
     */
}
```

Please note that the body of the function `lengthOfLIS` is empty in both versions of the code because the actual implementation details (the algorithm used to find the longest strictly increasing subsequence) were not provided in the original Python code.
