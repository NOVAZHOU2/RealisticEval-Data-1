Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python code with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Given an integer array `nums`, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
 *     Output: 4
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums - The integer array.
 * @returns {number} The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
    
}
```

This TypeScript function has the same parameters and return type as your original Python function, but with appropriate TypeScript syntax and documentation.
