Sure, here is the Java version of the Python code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Given an integer array nums and find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 * For example:
 *     input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
 *     output: 4
 *
 * @param nums The integer array.
 * @return The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
public int lengthOfLIS(List<Integer> nums) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, we use `List<Integer>` instead of `List[int]` and the method name starts with a lowercase letter according to Java naming conventions. Also, the return type is `int`.
