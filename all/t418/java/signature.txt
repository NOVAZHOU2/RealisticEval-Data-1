Sure, hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method with the appropriate Javadoc comments and type translations:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    /**
     * Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     *     Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
     *     Output: 4
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param nums the integer array
     * @return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
     */
    public static int lengthOfLIS(List<Integer> nums) {
        // Implementation would go here
        return 0; // Placeholder return value
    }

    // Other methods and logic can be added here if needed
}
```

In this translation:
- The method name `length_of_LIS` has been converted to `lengthOfLIS` to follow Java naming conventions (camelCase).
- The Python list type `List[int]` has been translated to `List<Integer>` in Java.
- The Python docstring has been converted to a Javadoc comment block.
- The return type `int` is preserved as `int` in Java.
- The placeholder return value `0` is used for completeness, but the actual implementation details are not provided here.
