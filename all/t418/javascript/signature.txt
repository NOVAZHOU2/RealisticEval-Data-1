Sure! Here is the JavaScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Given an integer array nums and find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 * For example:
 *     input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
 *     output: 4
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The integer array.
 * @return {number} - The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

This JavaScript function has the same parameters and return type as your original Python function, and it includes the JSDoc comment that describes what the function does, its arguments, and its return value.
