Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array.
 * 
 * Example:
 *   input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
 *   output: 4
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The integer array.
 * @returns {number} The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This conversion preserves the purpose and structure of the original Python code while adapting it to JavaScript syntax and JSDoc commenting conventions.
