Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

/**
 * @brief Find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
 * Output: 4
 *
 * @param nums The integer array.
 * @return int The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
int lengthOfLIS(const std::vector<int>& nums);
```

This function takes a constant reference to a vector of integers (`const std::vector<int>& nums`) and returns an integer representing the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
