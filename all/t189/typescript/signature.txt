Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided C++ function signature and comments, adapting the types and conventions appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Encodes a byte array into a Base64 encoded string.
 *
 * This function takes a Uint8Array data as input and converts it
 * into a Base64 encoded string.
 *
 * @param data A Uint8Array representing the input data to be encoded.
 * @return A string containing the Base64 encoded representation of the input data.
 */
function base64Encode(data: Uint8Array): string {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Changes Made:
- **Type**: The C++ `std::vector<unsigned char>` is replaced with `Uint8Array`, which is the TypeScript equivalent for an array of bytes.
- **Return Type**: The C++ `std::string` is replaced with `string` in TypeScript.
- **Function Name**: The function name is converted to camelCase (`base64Encode`) to follow TypeScript naming conventions.
