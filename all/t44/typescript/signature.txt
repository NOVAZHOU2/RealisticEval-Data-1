Here's how you can write the TypeScript version of your Python function signature:

```typescript
function alignLinesLeft(str1: string, str2: string): [string, string] {
    // ...
}
```

TypeScript uses `[]` instead of `Tuple<>`, and it doesn't require importing anything for type annotations like Python does with `typing`. The function name and argument names remain the same.
