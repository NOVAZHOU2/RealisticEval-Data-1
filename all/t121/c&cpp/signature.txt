Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments retained from your JavaScript version:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Adjust the length of the input array according to the given target length (number). 
 * If the current length of the array is longer than the target length, the first part 
 * of the array is intercepted to match the target length; If the current length of the 
 * array is shorter than the target length, the elements in the array are repeated until 
 * the target length is reached.
 * 
 * @param targetLength - The desired length for the array.
 * @param array - The input array to be adjusted.
 * @returns A new vector<int> that has been adjusted to the target length.
 */
std::vector<int> adjustArrayLength(int targetLength, const std::vector<int>& array) {
    // function implementation
}
```

This maintains the original comment structure while adapting it for C++. Let me know if you need any more changes!
