To convert the JavaScript code signature and its documentation to Python, we can use Python's docstring format along with the function signature. Hereâ€™s how you can translate the provided JavaScript code signature into Python:
python
def adjust_array_length(target_length: int, array: list) -> list:
    """
    Adjust the length of the input array according to the given target length. 
    If the current length of the array is longer than the target length, 
    the first part of the array is intercepted to match the target length. 
    If the current length of the array is shorter than the target length, 
    the elements in the array are repeated until the target length is reached.

    Args:
        target_length (int): The desired length for the array.
        array (list): The input array to be adjusted.

    Returns:
        list: A new array that has been adjusted to the target length.
    """
    array_length = len(array)  # Get the length of the array
    
    if array_length == target_length:
        return array  # If the array length matches the target, return the array
    
    if array_length < target_length:
        # Calculate how many times to repeat the array and flatten it
        repeated_array = (array * ((target_length // array_length) + 1))[:target_length]
        return repeated_array
    
    # If the array is longer than the target length, slice it
    return array[:target_length]

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3]
target_length = 8
adjusted_array = adjust_array_length(target_length, array)
print(adjusted_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
Key Changes:
Function Signature:
The function signature uses type hints in Python to specify the types of the parameters (target_length as int and array as list) and the return type as list.
Docstring:
The docstring is formatted using triple quotes (""") to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values. This is the Pythonic way to document functions and methods.
Implementation:
The function body remains the same as previously discussed.
This format allows users to easily understand the function's purpose and how to use it in Python.
