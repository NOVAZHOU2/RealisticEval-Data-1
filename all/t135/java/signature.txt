Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments adapted from your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Checks if the provided port number is within the valid range of TCP/UDP ports.
 * Valid TCP/UDP port numbers range from 1 to 65535.
 *
 * @param port The port number to verify.
 * @return Returns true if the port number is valid, false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean isValidPortNumber(int port) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. Changed the function signature to `public static boolean isValidPortNumber(int port)`.
2. Retained the comments and their structure.
3. The function body is left empty for implementation.
