To convert the JavaScript function signature and its accompanying documentation comment into Python code, we will use Python's conventions for type annotations and docstrings. Below is how you can represent the JavaScript code signature in Python:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def is_valid_port_number(port: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the provided port number is within the valid range of TCP/UDP ports.
    Valid TCP/UDP port numbers range from 1 to 65535.

    Args:
        port (int): The port number to verify.

    Returns:
        bool: Returns True if the port number is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The function is named is_valid_port_number, following Python's convention of using snake_case.
Parameter Annotation:
The parameter port is annotated with int, indicating that it should be an integer.
Return Type Annotation:
The return type is annotated with -> bool, indicating that the function will return a boolean value.
Docstring:
A docstring is provided to describe the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value. This replaces the JSDoc comment from the original JavaScript code.
Placeholder for Implementation:
The pass statement acts as a placeholder for the function's implementation, indicating that the function is defined but not yet implemented.
This Python signature maintains the same logical structure and intent as the original JavaScript signature while adhering to Python's syntax and documentation standards.
