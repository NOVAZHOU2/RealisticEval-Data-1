Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments translated from your JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Checks if the provided port number is within the valid range of TCP/UDP ports.
 * Valid TCP/UDP port numbers range from 1 to 65535.
 *
 * @param port - The port number to verify.
 * @returns true if the port number is valid, false otherwise.
 */
bool isValidPortNumber(int port);
```

This retains the same functionality as the JavaScript version, with appropriate C++ syntax for the function signature.
