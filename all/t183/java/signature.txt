Here's the equivalent Java code for the provided C++ signatures and comments:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Represents a point in 2D space.
 */
class Point {
    float x, y;

    Point(float x, float y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

/**
 * Represents a ray in 2D space.
 * The ray is defined by its origin and direction (which should be normalized).
 */
class Ray {
    Point origin;   // Starting point of the ray
    Point direction; // Direction of the ray (should be normalized)

    Ray(Point origin, Point direction) {
        this.origin = origin;
        this.direction = direction;
    }
}

/**
 * Represents a circle in 2D space.
 * The circle is defined by its center and radius.
 */
class Circle {
    Point center; // Center of the circle
    float radius; // Radius of the circle

    Circle(Point center, float radius) {
        this.center = center;
        this.radius = radius;
    }
}

/**
 * Determines whether a ray intersects with a circle.
 *
 * This method checks if a given ray intersects with a specified circle
 * in a 2D space. It performs mathematical calculations to determine if
 * the ray, defined by its origin and direction, crosses the area of the
 * circle defined by its center and radius.
 *
 * @param ray The ray to be tested for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as an origin point and a direction vector.
 * @param circle The circle to check for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as a center point and a radius.
 *
 * @return true if the ray intersects the circle; false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean intersects(Ray ray, Circle circle) {
    // Implementation would go here
    return false; // Placeholder return statement
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Class Definitions**: Converted `struct` definitions to `class`.
2. **Java Comments**: Transformed C++ comments and docstrings into Java Javadoc comments using the `/** */` format.
3. **Constructor Definitions**: Added constructors for each class to initialize their properties.
4. **Method Signature**: Changed the `intersects` function to a public static method, preserving the parameters and return type.
5. **Placeholder Implementation**: Added a placeholder return statement in the `intersects` method. 

This maintains the functionality while adapting to Java conventions.
