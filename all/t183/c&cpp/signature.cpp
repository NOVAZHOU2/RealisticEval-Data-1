/**
 * @brief Determines whether a ray intersects with a circle.
 *
 * This function checks if a given ray intersects with a specified circle
 * in a 2D space. It performs mathematical calculations to determine if
 * the ray, defined by its origin and direction, crosses the area of the
 * circle defined by its center and radius.
 *
 * @param ray The ray to be tested for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as an origin point and a direction vector.
 * @param circle The circle to check for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as a center point and a radius.
 *
 * @return true if the ray intersects the circle; false otherwise.
