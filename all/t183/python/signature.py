    Determines whether a ray intersects with a circle.

    Args:
        ray (Ray): The ray to be tested for intersection. It is assumed to contain properties such as an origin point (x, y) and a direction vector (dx, dy).
        circle (Circle): The circle to check for intersection. It is assumed to contain properties such as a center point (h, k) and a radius r.

        bool: True if the ray intersects the circle; False otherwise.
