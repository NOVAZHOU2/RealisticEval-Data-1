Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the position and bits of a specific character from a byte array.
 *
 * @param {Buffer} byteArray - The byte array to search within
 * @param {string} char - The character to find in the byte array
 * @param {string} [charset='utf-8'] - The character encoding of the byte array
 * @returns {Array|null} - A tuple of [position, bits] if the character is found, otherwise null.
 */
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc for documentation purposes, which is similar to Python's docstrings. The `@param` tag is used to describe the parameters, and the `@returns` tag is used to specify the return type. Note that JavaScript does not have a built-in way to represent optional parameters like Python, so I've included an example with a default value for `charset`. If you don't want to allow the user to pass a custom charset, you can simply remove the `[charset='utf-8']` part.
