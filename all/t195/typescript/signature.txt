Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript class signature along with the comments converted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * Implement a floating-point stack structure based on arrays
 *
 * This class provides basic stack operations including push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.
 * The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array. If the stack reaches its maximum capacity, no more elements
 * can be pushed onto it until space is freed by popping elements.
 */
class Stack {
    
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Class Name**: Changed from `stack_t` to `Stack` to follow TypeScript naming conventions (PascalCase).
2. **Comment Syntax**: C++ comments (`//` and `/* */`) have been converted to TypeScript-style comments, which are the same but retained for clarity.
3. **Functionality Preservation**: The class structure remains the same, ready for further method implementation.
