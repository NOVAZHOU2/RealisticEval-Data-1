To convert the given C++ code signature to a Python code signature while retaining the comments and adapting them to Python's comment style, you can follow the structure below:
C++ Code
cpp
/** 
 * Implement a floating-point stack structure based on arrays 
 * 
 * This class provides basic stack operations including push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty. 
 * The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array. If the stack reaches its maximum capacity, no more elements 
 * can be pushed onto it until space is freed by popping elements. 
 */
class stack_t {
Python Code
python
class Stack:
    """
    Implement a floating-point stack structure based on arrays.

    This class provides basic stack operations including push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.
    The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array. If the stack reaches its maximum capacity, no more elements
    can be pushed onto it until space is freed by popping elements.
    """
Changes Made:
Changed the class name from stack_t to Stack, following Python's naming conventions (CamelCase).
Converted the C-style block comment (/** ... */) to a Python docstring using triple quotes.
Adjusted the formatting of the comments to fit Python's style, while keeping the original meanings intact.
