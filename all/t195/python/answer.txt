Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the given C++ stack implementation. The code is rewritten to follow Python conventions while maintaining the same functionality.

Explanation of the Conversion:
Custom Exceptions:
Two custom exceptions, StackOverflowError and StackUnderflowError, are defined to handle stack overflow and underflow scenarios, respectively.
Class Definition:
The Stack class is defined, containing methods for stack operations and documentation strings explaining each method.
Constructor:
The __init__ method initializes the stack. An array of size MAX_SIZE is created, and the top index is set to -1 to indicate that the stack is empty.
Push Method:
The push method adds a floating-point number to the stack. It checks if the stack is full and raises a StackOverflowError if it is.
Pop Method:
The pop method removes and returns the top element of the stack. It raises a StackUnderflowError if the stack is empty.
Peek Method:
The peek method returns the top element without removing it and raises an exception if the stack is empty.
is_empty Method:
The is_empty method checks if the stack is empty, returning a boolean value.
This Python implementation maintains the same functionality as the original C++ code while adhering to Python's syntax and idiomatic practices.
