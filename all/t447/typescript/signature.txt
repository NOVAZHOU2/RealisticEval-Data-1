Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of your code signature, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user. Input birthDateString format such as 2000-01-01
 * @param birthDateString - The birth date as a string
 * @returns {string | number} - The calculated age or an error message
 */
function calculateAge(birthDateString: string): string | number {
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Type Annotations**: Added `: string` to `birthDateString` and specified the return type as `: string | number`. 

This enhances the clarity and type safety of your function signature!
