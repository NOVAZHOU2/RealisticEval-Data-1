Here's the C++ code signature with comments based on your JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user. Input birthDateString format such as 2000-01-01
 * @param birthDateString
 * @returns int
 */
int calculateAge(const std::string& birthDateString) {
}
```

This retains the original intent and structure of your JavaScript comments while adapting it to C++.
