Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments based on your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user. Input birthDateString format such as 2000-01-01
 * @param birthDateString the birth date in string format
 * @return the age as a string or a message indicating an invalid date
 */
public static String calculateAge(String birthDateString) {
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from your original JavaScript code!
