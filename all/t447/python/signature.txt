Sure, here is the equivalent Python function with the same signature and comments:

```python
# Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user.
# Input birthDateString format such as "2000-01-01"
def calculate_age(birth_date_string):
    pass
```

This Python function `calculate_age` takes one parameter `birth_date_string`, which is expected to be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". The function does not return any value (`None`) at the moment because it's currently empty (denoted by `pass`).
