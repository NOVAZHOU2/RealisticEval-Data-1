Certainly! Below is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same functionality and comments:

```python
"""
Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user.
Input birth_date_string format such as '2000-01-01'

:param birth_date_string: str
:return: int or str
"""
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_age(birth_date_string):
    # Convert the birth date string to a datetime object
    birth_date = datetime.strptime(birth_date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')
    
    # Get today's date
    today = datetime.today()
    
    # Calculate the preliminary age
    age = today.year - birth_date.year
    
    # Adjust the age if the current date is before the birthday in the current year
    if today.month < birth_date.month or (today.month == birth_date.month and today.day < birth_date.day):
        age -= 1
    
    return age
```

This Python function `calculate_age` takes a birth date string in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, calculates the age, and returns it as an integer. The comments have been preserved to explain the purpose and usage of the function.
