To convert the given JavaScript code signature and documentation comment into a Python function signature and docstring, we need to follow Python conventions for type hints and documentation. Below is the Python equivalent of your JavaScript function signature with a docstring that reflects the original JavaScript comments.
Python Function Signature:
python
def calculate_age(birth_date_string: str) -> str | int:
    """
    Calculate age based on the birth date string entered by the user.
    
    Input birth_date_string format such as "2000-01-01".
    
    Args:
        birth_date_string (str): The birth date in string format.
    
    Returns:
        str | int: The age as an integer or an error message as a string 
                    if the date format is invalid.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation will go here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The function is named calculate_age, which is a direct translation of the JavaScript function name.
Parameter Type Hint:
birth_date_string: str indicates that the parameter is expected to be a string.
Return Type Hint:
-> str | int indicates that the function may return either a string (for error messages) or an integer (for the calculated age). This is supported in Python 3.10 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can replace str | int with Union[str, int] from the typing module:
python
from typing import Union
def calculate_age(birth_date_string: str) -> Union[str, int]:
Docstring:
The docstring describes what the function does, the format of the input, the arguments, and the return values, similar to the JSDoc style in JavaScript.
Function Implementation:
The pass statement is a placeholder for where the function's logic will be implemented.
Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you could use this function in a Python script after implementing its logic:
python
# Example call to the function (implementation needed)
age = calculate_age("2000-01-01")
print(age)  # This would print the age or an error message
You can replace the pass statement with the actual implementation of the age calculation as previously provided.
