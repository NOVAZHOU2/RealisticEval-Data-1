Here's the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Determines whether a given string (assumed to end with ".bit") is a valid 3-digit integer.
 * Removes the ".bit" suffix, checks if the remaining part is a number and verifies if it falls within the range of 0 to 999.
 *
 * @param bitName - The string to validate.
 * @returns True if the remaining part after removing ".bit" is a valid 3-digit integer, otherwise false.
 */
bool assert999(const std::string& bitName) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```
