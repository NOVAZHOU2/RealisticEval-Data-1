Here’s how you can convert the provided TypeScript function signature to Python, while keeping the comments intact:
python
def assert999(bit_name: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether a given string (assumed to end with ".bit") is a valid 3-digit integer.
    Removes the ".bit" suffix, checks if the remaining part is a number 
    and verifies if it falls within the range of 0 to 999.

    :param bit_name: The string to validate.
    :return: True if the remaining part after removing ".bit" is a valid 3-digit integer, otherwise false.
    """
    pass  # Replace with the implementation
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Definition: The function keyword in TypeScript is replaced with def in Python.
Parameter Types: The parameter type annotation bitName: string is changed to bit_name: str. In Python, str is used for strings.
Return Type: The return type annotation : boolean is replaced with -> bool. In Python, bool is used for boolean values.
Docstring: The comment block in TypeScript is converted into a Python docstring by using triple quotes (""") and adjusting the format to Python standards. The parameter and return type annotations are specified using the :param and :return syntax, respectively.
Function Body: The body of the function is defined with pass, indicating that it’s a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual implementation later.
This Python code retains the structure and functionality of the original TypeScript function while adhering to Python syntax and conventions.
