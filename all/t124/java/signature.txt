Here’s the Java code signature with comments converted from your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * Randomly shuffles the elements of the input array in place.
 *
 * @param array - The array of elements to be shuffled.
 * @return - The shuffled array with its elements in random order.
 */
public static int[] shuffle(int[] array) {
    // function implementation
}
```
