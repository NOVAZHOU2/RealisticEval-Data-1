Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments based on your JavaScript example:

```cpp
/**
 * Randomly shuffles the elements of the input vector in place.
 *
 * @param std::vector<int>& array - The vector of elements to be shuffled.
 * @returns std::vector<int> - The shuffled vector with its elements in random order.
 */
std::vector<int> shuffle(std::vector<int>& array) {
    // function implementation
}
``` 

This preserves the original comments while adapting them to C++.
