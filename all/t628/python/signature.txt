To convert the given Java method signature into Python, we need to follow these steps:
Translate the method name: In Python, methods are typically defined using the def keyword.
Change parameter types: Python is dynamically typed, so we don't need to specify types like in Java.
Handle exceptions: In Python, we typically use try and except blocks for exception handling instead of specifying them in the function signature.
Use a docstring: Python uses triple quotes for documentation strings.
Hereâ€™s how you can write the equivalent Python function signature based on the provided Java code:
python
def modify_line_in_file(file_path: str, line_number: int, new_value: str) -> None:
    """
    Modifies a specific line in the given file.

    :param file_path: The path of the file to be modified.
    :param line_number: The line number to be modified (1-based index).
    :param new_value: The new value to update the line with.
    :raises IOError: If an I/O error occurs.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Breakdown of the Translation:
Function Definition: def modify_line_in_file(...) defines a function in Python.
Parameters: file_path, line_number, and new_value are provided with type hints (str, int, str), which are optional in Python but improve code readability.
Return Type: -> None indicates that this function does not return any value.
Docstring: The docstring uses a format similar to the Java comments, explaining the parameters and the potential exceptions.
Note on Exception Handling:
The IOError in the docstring corresponds to IOException in Java, though in modern Python (3.x), it's common to catch OSError for a wider range of I/O-related exceptions.
When implementing the function, you would include a try-except block to handle any I/O errors appropriately.
