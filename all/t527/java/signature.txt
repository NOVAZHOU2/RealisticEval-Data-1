Sure, here is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Check if a point is inside a triangle defined by three vertices.
 *
 * @param px The x-coordinate of the point to check.
 * @param py The y-coordinate of the point to check.
 * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle.
 * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle.
 * @param x3 The x-coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y3 The y-coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle.
 * @return true if the point (px, py) is inside or on the edge of the triangle formed by the vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3); false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean isPointInsideTriangle(double px, double py, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, method signatures include the return type and parameter types explicitly. Also, Java uses `double` instead of `float` for floating-point numbers. You will need to implement the logic for checking if a point is inside a triangle within the body of the `isPointInsideTriangle` method.
