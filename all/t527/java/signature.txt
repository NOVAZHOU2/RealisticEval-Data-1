### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined with the package `org.real.temp`.
2. **Javadoc Comments**: Detailed Javadoc comments are provided for both methods, explaining the parameters and return values.
3. **Method Definitions**:
   - `isPointInsideTriangle`: This method checks if a point is inside a triangle.
   - `calculateTriangleArea`: This helper method calculates the area of a triangle given its vertices.
4. **Floating Point Comparison**: A small epsilon (`1e-9`) is used for comparing floating-point numbers to handle precision issues.

This Java code preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to Java's conventions and best practices.
