Sure! Here's the equivalent TypeScript function signature with comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Check if a point is inside a triangle defined by three vertices.
 *
 * @param px - The x-coordinate of the point to check.
 * @param py - The y-coordinate of the point to check.
 * @param x1 - The x-coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y1 - The y-coordinate of the first vertex of the triangle.
 * @param x2 - The x-coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y2 - The y-coordinate of the second vertex of the triangle.
 * @param x3 - The x-coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle.
 * @param y3 - The y-coordinate of the third vertex of the triangle.
 * @returns true if the point (px, py) is inside or on the edge of the triangle formed by the vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3); false otherwise.
 */
function isPointInsideTriangle(px: number, py: number, x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number, x3: number, y3: number): boolean {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript version maintains the same structure and comments as your original Python function.
