To convert the JavaScript documentation style to Python's conventions, we will use a docstring format that adheres to Python's PEP 257 guidelines. Below is the equivalent Python function signature with the appropriate docstring:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Safely splices an array by removing a specified number of elements from a given index,
 * and optionally replaces them with a new element.
 * 
 * @param {Array} inputArray - The original array to be modified.
 * @param {number} amountToRemove - The number of elements to remove from the array.
 * @param {number} indexToRemove - The index at which to start removing elements.
 * @param {*} [replaceWith] - Optional. The element to replace the removed elements with.
 * @returns {Array} - A new array with the specified elements removed and optionally replaced.
 */
function safeSplice(inputArray, amountToRemove, indexToRemove, replaceWith) {
    // function implementation
}
Python Code Signature
python
def safe_splice(input_array, amount_to_remove, index_to_remove, replace_with=None):
    """
    Safely splices an array by removing a specified number of elements from a given index,
    and optionally replaces them with a new element.

    Args:
        input_array (list): The original array to be modified.
        amount_to_remove (int): The number of elements to remove from the array.
        index_to_remove (int): The index at which to start removing elements.
        replace_with (any, optional): The element to replace the removed elements with.

    Returns:
        list: A new array with the specified elements removed and optionally replaced.
    """
    # function implementation
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function is defined with def, following Python's syntax conventions.
Docstring Format:
The docstring starts and ends with triple quotes (""") and describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.
Each parameter is described with its name, type, and a brief description.
The Args section specifies the types of each parameter and includes a note that replace_with is optional.
The Returns section describes the return type and its purpose.
Parameter Names:
Parameter names are converted from camelCase (used in JavaScript) to snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
This structure not only documents the function clearly but also makes it easier for other developers to understand the usage and expected behavior of the safe_splice function in Python.
