Sure! Below is an example of how you might convert your Python unittest test class into a Jest test case in JavaScript. For this example, I'll assume you have a corresponding function `applyShearX` that performs the same operation in JavaScript using a library like Lodash or NumJS for matrix operations.

First, let's define the `applyShearX` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

function applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor) {
    // Assuming matrix is a 2D array and shearFactor is a number
    return _.map(matrix, row => 
        _.map(row, (value, index) => value + shearFactor * row[index - 1])
    );
}
```

Now, let's write the Jest test case:

```javascript
const applyShearX = require('./path/to/your/applyShearX'); // Adjust the path accordingly

describe('applyShearX', () => {
    it('should apply a shear transformation to a 2D matrix along the x-axis', () => {
        const matrix = [
            [1, 2],
            [3, 4]
        ];
        const shearFactor = 0.5;
        const expected = [
            [1, 2.5],
            [3, 4.5]
        ];

        expect(applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor)).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should handle negative shear factors correctly', () => {
        const matrix = [
            [1, 2],
            [3, 4]
        ];
        const shearFactor = -0.5;
        const expected = [
            [1, 1.5],
            [3, 2.5]
        ];

        expect(applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor)).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should handle matrices with different dimensions correctly', () => {
        const matrix = [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6]
        ];
        const shearFactor = 1.0;
        const expected = [
            [1, 3, 5],
            [4, 7, 10]
        ];

        expect(applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor)).toEqual(expected);
    });
});
```

In this Jest test case:

- We import the `applyShearX` function from the specified path.
- We use the `describe` function to group related tests together.
- Each `it` function contains a specific test case, including the input matrix, shear factor, and the expected output.
- We use the `expect` function to assert that the actual output matches the expected output.

Make sure to adjust the path to the `applyShearX` function according to your project structure.
