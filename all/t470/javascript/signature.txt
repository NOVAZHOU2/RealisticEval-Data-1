Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JavaScript documentation standards using JSDoc format. We will also use the `mathjs` library for matrix operations.

### JavaScript Code

First, ensure you have `mathjs` installed:

```bash
npm install mathjs
```

Here is the JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Import the mathjs library for matrix operations
const math = require('mathjs');

/**
 * Applies a shear transformation to a 2D matrix along the x-axis.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A 2D array representing the original matrix.
 * @param {number} shearFactor - The factor by which the matrix is sheared along the x-axis.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} The sheared matrix.
 */
function applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor) {
    // Define the shear transformation matrix for shearing along the x-axis
    const shearMatrix = [[1, shearFactor], [0, 1]];

    // Applying the shear transformation
    // Use mathjs for matrix multiplication
    const transformedMatrix = math.multiply(matrix, shearMatrix);

    return transformedMatrix;
}

// Example usage
const originalMatrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
];

const shearFactor = 0.5;

const shearedMatrix = applyShearX(originalMatrix, shearFactor);
console.log(shearedMatrix);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing `mathjs`**:
   - The `mathjs` library is imported for matrix operations.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The function signature and comments are rewritten using JSDoc format for better documentation.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The `applyShearX` function takes a 2D matrix and a shear factor as arguments.

4. **Shear Matrix**:
   - A shear matrix is defined for shearing along the x-axis.

5. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - The `math.multiply` function from `mathjs` is used to perform matrix multiplication.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - The transformed matrix is returned.

7. **Example Usage**:
   - An example is provided to demonstrate how to use the function.

This code preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to JavaScript conventions and documentation standards.
