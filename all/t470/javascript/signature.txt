Sure! Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Applies a shear transformation to a 2D matrix along the x-axis.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A 2D array representing the original matrix.
 * @param {number} shearFactor - The factor by which the matrix is sheared along the x-axis.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} The sheared matrix.
 */
function applyShearX(matrix, shearFactor) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

This JavaScript function signature matches the functionality of your Python function, including the docstring that describes what the function does and its parameters.
