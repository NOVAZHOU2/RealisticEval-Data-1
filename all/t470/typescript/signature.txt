Sure! Below is the TypeScript code signature for the given Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Applies a shear transformation to a 2D matrix along the x-axis.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 2D array representing the original matrix.
 * @param shearFactor - The factor by which the matrix is sheared along the x-axis.
 * @returns The sheared matrix.
 */
function applyShearX(matrix: number[][], shearFactor: number): number[][] {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

This TypeScript function `applyShearX` takes a 2D array (`matrix`) and a `shearFactor` as arguments and returns a new 2D array representing the sheared matrix.
