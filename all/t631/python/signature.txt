Here’s how you can convert the given Java function signature to a Python function signature. The conversion retains the intended functionality and adheres to Python’s conventions.
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Formats a list of strings into a single-line CSV string and writes it to a specified file.
 *
 * @param strings List of strings to be formatted into CSV.
 * @param filePath The file path where the CSV string should be written.
 */
public void writeCsvToFile(List<String> strings, String filePath) {}
Converted Python Function Signature
python
def write_csv_to_file(strings: list[str], file_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Formats a list of strings into a single-line CSV string and writes it to a specified file.

    :param strings: List of strings to be formatted into CSV.
    :param file_path: The file path where the CSV string should be written.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation will go here
Key Changes Explained
Function Definition: The Java public void is replaced by def in Python, which defines a function. Python does not use access modifiers like public, as all functions are public by default.
Parameter Types:
In Java, List<String> is replaced with list[str] in Python, indicating that the parameter strings should be a list of strings.
The filePath parameter in Java is replaced with file_path in Python to follow the snake_case naming convention.
Return Type: The Java void return type is replaced by -> None in Python, indicating that this function does not return a value.
Docstring: The Java comment block is translated into a Python docstring, which provides a description of the function and its parameters.
Implementation Placeholder: The body of the function is represented by pass, which serves as a placeholder until the actual implementation is added.
Summary
This conversion maintains the intended functionality and adheres to Python’s syntax and style conventions. The function signature can now be implemented with the logic to write a list of strings to a CSV file as needed.
