Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with \n\n and lines end with \n.
 * 
 * @param {string} text - The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @returns {Object} An object containing:
 *   - 'paragraphs': An array of paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *   - 'lines': An array of lines extracted from the text.
 */
function extract_paragraphs_and_lines(text) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that the implementation details are not provided in your Python code snippet, so you would need to fill in the logic inside the JavaScript function based on how it is implemented in Python.
