Here's how you can convert your Python unittest test class to a Jest test case in JavaScript. Note that I'm assuming you have a function `extractParagraphsAndLines` that performs the same operation as your Python function.

```javascript
// Import the function to be tested
const { extractParagraphsAndLines } = require('./path_to_your_module');

describe('extractParagraphsAndLines', () => {
  it('should correctly extract paragraphs and lines from the given text', () => {
    const text = "First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line.";
    const result = extractParagraphsAndLines(text);

    expect(result).toEqual({
      paragraphs: [
        "First paragraph.",
        "This is the second line."
      ],
      lines: [
        "First paragraph.",
        "This is the second line.",
        "Second paragraph.",
        "Another line."
      ]
    });
  });

  // Add more tests here...
});
```

In this example, we're using Jest's `describe` and `it` functions to create a test suite and individual test cases. We're also using Jest's `expect` function to assert that the output of our function matches what we expect.

Please replace `'./path_to_your_module'` with the actual path to your module file. Also, ensure that the function name and parameters match those in your Python function.
