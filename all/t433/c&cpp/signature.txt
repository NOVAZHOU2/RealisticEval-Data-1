Sure, here's how you can convert the Python function signature to a C++ function signature while keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with \n\n and lines end with \n.
 * For example:
 *     input: First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line.
 *     output:
 *
 * @param text The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @return A dictionary containing:
 *         - 'paragraphs': A vector of paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *         - 'lines': A vector of lines extracted from the text.
 */
std::pair<std::vector<std::string>, std::vector<std::string>> extract_paragraphs_and_lines(const std::string& text);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Return Type**: In C++, we use `std::pair` to return multiple values from a function. Here, it returns two vectors: one for paragraphs and another for lines.
2. **Parameters**: The function takes a constant reference to a `std::string` as its parameter.
3. **Comments**: Comments are kept in Doxygen format to maintain consistency with Python docstrings.

This should serve as a good starting point for implementing the function in C++.
