Here is the equivalent C++ function signature and documentation for the given Python code:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with "\n\n" and lines end with "\n".
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input: "First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line."
 *     Output: (See function behavior for exact output structure)
 * 
 * @param text The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @return A map containing:
 *         - 'paragraphs': A vector of strings representing paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *         - 'lines': A vector of strings representing lines extracted from the text.
 */
std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> extract_paragraphs_and_lines(const std::string& text) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this translation, the Python `dict` is represented by a `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>` in C++, where the keys are strings and the values are vectors of strings. The function takes a `const std::string&` as its argument, which corresponds to the Python `str` type. The C++ comments have been formatted according to C++ standards.
