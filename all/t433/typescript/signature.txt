Here's the equivalent TypeScript code with the appropriate JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with `\n\n` and lines end with `\n`.
 * 
 * Example:
 *   Input: "First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line."
 *   Output:
 *     {
 *       paragraphs: ["First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.", "Second paragraph.\nAnother line."],
 *       lines: ["First paragraph.", "This is the second line.", "Second paragraph.", "Another line."]
 *     }
 * 
 * @param text The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @returns An object containing:
 *   - 'paragraphs': An array of paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *   - 'lines': An array of lines extracted from the text.
 */
function extractParagraphsAndLines(text: string): { paragraphs: string[], lines: string[] } {
    const paragraphs = text.split('\n\n').map(paragraph => paragraph.trim());
    const lines = text.split('\n').map(line => line.trim());

    return {
        paragraphs,
        lines
    };
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Signature**: `function extractParagraphsAndLines(text: string): { paragraphs: string[], lines: string[] }`
   - The function takes a single parameter `text` of type `string`.
   - It returns an object with two properties: `paragraphs` and `lines`, both of which are arrays of strings.

2. **Documentation Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block provides a description of the function, examples, and detailed explanations of the parameters and return values.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The `split` method is used to split the text into paragraphs and lines based on the specified delimiters (`\n\n` and `\n`).
   - The `map` method is used to trim each paragraph and line to remove leading and trailing whitespace.

This TypeScript code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code while adhering to TypeScript syntax and conventions.
