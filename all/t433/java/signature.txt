Here's the equivalent Java code signature for your Python function, including comments:

```java
/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with \n\n and lines end with \n.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input: "First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line."
 *     Output: 
 *         {
 *             "paragraphs": ["First paragraph.", "This is the second line."],
 *             "lines": ["First paragraph.", "This is the second line.", "Second paragraph.", "Another line."]
 *         }
 * 
 * @param text The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @return A map containing:
 *         - "paragraphs": A list of paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *         - "lines": A list of lines extracted from the text.
 */
public Map<String, List<String>> extractParagraphsAndLines(String text) {
```

In Java, we use `Map` instead of `dict`, and `List` instead of `list`. The method signature includes the return type (`Map<String, List<String>>`) and the parameter type (`String`).
