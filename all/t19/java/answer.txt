Sure, here's how you can convert your Python function into Java code:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Determines whether the string contains a phone number;
     * a possible format for a phone number is +1-800-555-1234, 555-555-1234, 555 555 1234.
     *
     * @param s The input string which may contain a phone number.
     * @return true if the string contains a phone number, false otherwise.
     */
    public static boolean containsPhoneNumber(String s) {
        // Regular expression to match the phone number formats
        String regex = "\\+?\\d{1,3}-?\\d{3}-?\\d{3}-?\\d{4}|\\d{3} \\d{3} \\d{4}";
        
        return s.matches(regex);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package and Class Declaration**: The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;` followed by the class declaration `public class Answer`.
   
2. **Method Signature**: The method `containsPhoneNumber` is declared as `public static`, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

3. **Regular Expression**: A regular expression (`regex`) is used to match the different phone number formats. This regex checks for optional leading `+` sign, followed by 1 to 3 digits, and then three groups of 3 digits separated by hyphens or spaces.

4. **String Matching**: The `matches` method from the `String` class is used to check if the input string `s` matches the defined regular expression.

This Java code should work similarly to your original Python function, checking if a given string contains a valid phone number in one of the specified formats.
