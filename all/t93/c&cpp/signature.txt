Here's the C++ code signature with comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * produces a character array of length 52 containing all lowercase and uppercase letters in alphabetical order
 *
 * @returns std::vector<char> A vector of alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z'.
 */
std::vector<char> getAllAlphabets() {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
``` 

This maintains the structure and intent of your JavaScript signature while adapting it for C++.
