Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Produces a character array of length 52 containing all lowercase and uppercase letters in alphabetical order.
 *
 * @return An array of alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z'.
 */
public static char[] getAllAlphabets() {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
``` 

This maintains the original structure while converting it to Java syntax.
