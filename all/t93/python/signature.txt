To convert the given JavaScript function signature, along with its documentation, into a Python function signature, you'll follow Python's conventions for type hints and docstrings.
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * produces a character array of length 52 containing all lowercase uppercase letters in alphabetical order
 * @returns {string[]} An array of alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z'.
 */
function getAllAlphabets() {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def get_all_alphabets() -> list[str]:
    """
    Produces a list of length 52 containing all lowercase and uppercase letters in alphabetical order.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z'.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Name:
Converted from getAllAlphabets (camelCase in JavaScript) to get_all_alphabets (snake_case in Python) to follow Python naming conventions.
Return Type Hint:
The return type is specified using Python's type hinting: -> list[str]. This indicates that the function returns a list of strings.
Docstring:
The comment documentation is converted into a docstring that explains what the function does and its return type, using the format typical in Python.
Function Body:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function implementation, indicating that the function is currently not doing anything.
This signature now conforms to Python's style while preserving the meaning and intent of the original JavaScript documentation.
