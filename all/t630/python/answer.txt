Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Java class Answer, including its methods, to a Python equivalent. The Python code will include the same functionalities, such as performing insertion sort and displaying the array.
Converted Python Code
python
class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def insertion_sort(arr):
        """Method to perform insertion sort on the array."""
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Current element to be inserted into sorted portion
            key = arr[i]
            j = i - 1
            # Move elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key
            # to one position ahead of their current position
            while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
            arr[j + 1] = key

    @staticmethod
    def show(arr):
        """Method to display the array (optional for testing purposes)."""
        for element in arr:
            print(element, end=' ')
        print()

    @staticmethod
    def main():
        """Main method to test the insertion_sort function."""
        arr = [12.4, 11.2, 13.5, 5.6, 6.7]
        print("Original array:")
        Answer.show(arr)
        # Perform insertion sort
        Answer.insertion_sort(arr)
        print("Sorted array:")
        Answer.show(arr)

# Entry point to execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Answer.main()
Key Changes Explained
Class Declaration: The Java public class Answer is translated to class Answer in Python.
Static Methods: The Java static methods are declared in Python using the @staticmethod decorator.
Array Declaration: In Python, lists are used instead of arrays. The initialization of the array uses square brackets ([]).
Length of the Array: arr.length in Java is replaced with len(arr) in Python.
Loop Syntax: The for loop syntax in Python uses range(), and the while loop syntax remains largely the same.
Printing: Instead of using System.out.print(), we use print() in Python. To avoid automatic newline after each print, end=' ' is used in the show method.
Main Method: The main method in Python is defined as a static method. The check for __name__ == "__main__" is used to execute the main method when the script is run directly.
Running the Code
To run this code:
Save it to a file named answer.py.
Run the script using Python:
bash
python answer.py
This will display the original array and the sorted array after applying the insertion sort algorithm.
