Hereâ€™s how you can convert the Java function signature to a Python function signature while maintaining the same documentation style.
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Sorts an array of doubles in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
 *
 * The insertion sort algorithm works by dividing the array into a sorted and an
 * unsorted portion. It iterates through the unsorted portion, taking one element
 * (the key) at a time and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion.
 *
 * @param arr the array of doubles to be sorted
 */
public static void insertionSort(double[] arr) {}
Converted Python Function Signature
python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts a list of floats in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.

    The insertion sort algorithm works by dividing the list into a sorted and an
    unsorted portion. It iterates through the unsorted portion, taking one element
    (the key) at a time and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion.

    :param arr: The list of floats to be sorted.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the sorting logic
Key Changes Explained
Function Definition: The public static void in Java is replaced with the Python def keyword.
Parameter Type: In Java, the parameter type is specified as double[], while in Python, we use a list of floats, which is simply indicated by arr without type declaration.
Docstring: The documentation style is converted to a Python docstring, using triple quotes. The parameter is described with :param syntax for clarity.
Placeholder: The Java method body is empty; similarly, the Python function has a pass statement as a placeholder for where the sorting logic will go.
You can now fill in the logic for the insertion_sort function as needed.
