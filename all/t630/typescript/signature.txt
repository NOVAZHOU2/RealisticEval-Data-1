Here's the TypeScript equivalent of the provided Python function signature and its documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Sorts a list of floats in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The list of floats to be sorted.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function insertionSort(arr: number[]): void {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

This retains the original functionality and structure while adapting the comments and types to TypeScript standards.
