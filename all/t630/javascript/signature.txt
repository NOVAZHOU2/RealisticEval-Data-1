Here's the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Sorts an array of floats in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The array of floats to be sorted.
 */
function insertionSort(arr) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the purpose and structure of the original Python code while adapting the comments appropriately.
