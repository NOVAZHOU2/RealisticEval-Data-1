Here is your Python code signature converted into TypeScript:

```typescript
import { DateTime } from "luxon";

/**
 * Returns the current time information including year, month, week of the month, and day of the week.
 *
 * @param testDate - The date to compute information for, defaults to today's date if not provided.
 * @returns A dictionary containing the year, month, week of the month, and day of the week.
 */
function getCurrentDateInfo(testDate?: DateTime): { year: number; month: string; weekOfTheMonth: number; dayOfWeek: string } {
    // ...
}
```

Please note that in TypeScript, we don't use `dict` type like in Python. Instead, we use an object with named properties. Also, TypeScript doesn't have a built-in `DateTime` class like Python does, so you would need to install a library such as `luxon` or `moment.js`.
