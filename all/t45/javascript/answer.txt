Here is your Python function translated into JavaScript:

```javascript
function get_current_date_info(testDate = new Date()) {
    let date = new Date(testDate);
    let year = date.getFullYear();
    let monthNames = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
      "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
    ];
    let month = monthNames[date.getMonth()];
    let weekOfTheMonth = Math.ceil(date.getDate() / 7);
    let daysOfWeek = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
    let dayOfWeek = daysOfWeek[date.getDay()];
  
    return { 
        'year': year,
        'month': month,
        'week_of_the_month': weekOfTheMonth,
        'day_of_the_week': dayOfWeek
    };
}
```

In this JavaScript version, we use `new Date()` to create a date object from the input date or the current date if no date is provided. Then we extract the year, month, day of the week and week of the month using the respective methods provided by the Date object. The month names are stored in an array for easy lookup. Finally, we construct and return a JavaScript object with these properties.
