Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code that maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the provided Python code:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment'); // You need to install moment.js using npm or include it in your HTML file

function get_current_date_info(test_date = null) {
    /**
     * Returns the current time information including year, month, week of the month, and day of the week.
     * Optionally takes a date object for testing purposes.
     *
     * @param {Date} test_date - The date to compute information for, defaults to today's date if not provided.
     *
     * @returns {Object} An object containing the year, month, week of the month, and day of the week.
     */
    let today = test_date ? test_date : new Date();

    const year = today.getFullYear();
    const month = moment(today).format('MMMM');
    const day_of_week = moment(today).format('dddd');

    // Calculate the week of the month
    const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 1);
    const firstDayWeekday = firstDayOfMonth.getDay();
    const week_of_month = Math.ceil((today.getDate() + firstDayWeekday) / 7);

    return {
        'year': year,
        'month': month,
        'week_of_the_month': week_of_month,
        'day_of_the_week': day_of_week
    };
}

// Example usage
console.log(get_current_date_info());
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `moment`**: We use `moment.js` to handle some date manipulations more easily. You can install it via npm or include it in your HTML file.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `get_current_date_info` is defined with an optional parameter `test_date`.
3. **Current Date**: If `test_date` is not provided, we use the current date; otherwise, we use the provided date.
4. **Year and Month**: We use `getFullYear()` and `moment` to format the month name.
5. **Day of the Week**: We use `moment` to format the day of the week.
6. **Week of the Month Calculation**: We calculate the week of the month based on the day of the month and the weekday of the first day of the month.
7. **Return Object**: We return an object containing the year, month, week of the month, and day of the week.

### Note:
- Ensure you have `moment.js` installed or included in your project.
- The `moment` library provides convenient methods for formatting dates and handling weekdays.
