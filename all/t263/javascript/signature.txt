Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript class definition for the `MatrixTraversal` class, including the `spiral_traversal` method, with comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
class MatrixTraversal {
  /**
   * Traverse a given m x n matrix in a spiral order and return all elements as an array.
   *
   * The function starts at the top-left corner of the matrix and traverses it in a
   * clockwise spiral order, moving right across the top row, down the right column,
   * left across the bottom row, and up the left column, repeating this process
   * until all elements are traversed.
   *
   * @param {number[][]} matrix - A 2D array representing the matrix with m rows and n columns.
   * @returns {number[]} An array of numbers representing the elements of the matrix
   *                     in the order they were traversed.
   */
  spiral_traversal(matrix) {
    // Implementation of the spiral traversal algorithm goes here.
  }
}
```

This JavaScript code preserves the structure and purpose of the original Python class and method, and the comments have been adapted to follow JSDoc conventions.
