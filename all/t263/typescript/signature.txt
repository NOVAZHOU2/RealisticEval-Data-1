Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python class and method:

```typescript
class MatrixTraversal {
  /**
   * Traverse a given m x n matrix in a spiral order and return all elements as an array.
   *
   * The function starts at the top-left corner of the matrix and traverses it in a
   * clockwise spiral order, moving right across the top row, down the right column,
   * left across the bottom row, and up the left column, repeating this process
   * until all elements are traversed.
   *
   * @param matrix - A 2D array representing the matrix with m rows and n columns.
   * @returns An array of numbers representing the elements of the matrix
   *          in the order they were traversed.
   */
  spiralTraversal(matrix: number[][]): number[] {
    // Implementation goes here
  }
}
```

In this TypeScript code, we have:

1. Translated the Python class `MatrixTraversal` to TypeScript.
2. Converted the method signature `spiral_traversal` to `spiralTraversal`.
3. Preserved the type annotations, where `List[List[int]]` becomes `number[][]` and `List[int]` becomes `number[]`.
4. Added JSDoc comments to describe the purpose of the method, its parameters, and its return value.
