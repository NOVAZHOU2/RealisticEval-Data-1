```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Traverse a given m x n matrix in a spiral order and return all elements as a vector.
 *
 * The function starts at the top-left corner of the matrix and traverses it in a
 * clockwise spiral order, moving right across the top row, down the right column,
 * left across the bottom row, and up the left column, repeating this process
 * until all elements are traversed.
 *
 * @param matrix A 2D vector representing the matrix with m rows and n columns.
 * @return A vector of integers representing the elements of the matrix
 *         in the order they were traversed.
 */
vector<int> spiralTraverse(const vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    // Implementation goes here...
}

This C++ version keeps the structure and comments similar to your original Python code. However, note that the actual implementation of the `spiralTraverse` function is not provided here and would need to be filled out according to your specific requirements.
