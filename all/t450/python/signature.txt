To convert the provided JavaScript function signature and comments to a Python function signature and comments, you can follow this structure:
Use Python's def keyword to define the function.
Replace the JavaScript comment style with Python's triple quotes for documentation.
Update the type hinting to reflect the parameter type and return type.
Hereâ€™s how the JavaScript code can be translated into Python:
python
def is_valid_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks whether the provided password meets the specified format requirements:
    - At least one number
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one punctuation mark
    - Minimum length of 8 characters

    Args:
        password (str): The password string to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: Returns True if the password meets all requirements; otherwise, False.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the implementation
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition: The function is defined using def, followed by the function name is_valid_password.
Type Hinting: The parameter password is typed as str, and the return type is indicated as bool.
Docstring: A detailed description is provided in a docstring format that explains the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
Placeholder: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for where the actual implementation of the function would go.
You can replace the pass with the actual logic to validate the password based on the specified requirements when you're ready to implement the function.
