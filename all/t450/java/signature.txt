Here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Validates whether the provided password meets the following criteria:
 * - Contains at least one digit
 * - Contains at least one lowercase character
 * - Contains at least one uppercase character
 * - Contains at least one special character
 * - Has a minimum length of 8 characters
 *
 * @param password The password string to be validated
 * @return true if the password meets all the requirements, false otherwise
 */
public static boolean isValidPassword(String password) {
}
```

Please note that in Java, we don't use JSDoc style comments for public methods. Instead, we typically use standard JavaDoc comments. Also, unlike JavaScript, Java doesn't have built-in types like `string` or `boolean`, so we need to specify these explicitly. In the example above, I've used `String` and `boolean`. If you're using a different naming convention or additional libraries, you may need to adjust accordingly.
