Certainly! Below is the C++ code signature with the same comments as your JavaScript function:

```cpp
/**
 * Checks whether the provided password meets the specified format requirements:
 * - At least one number
 * - At least one lowercase letter
 * - At least one uppercase letter
 * - At least one punctuation mark
 * - Minimum length of 8 characters
 *
 * @param password - The password string to validate
 * @return true if the password meets all requirements; otherwise, false.
 */
bool isValidPassword(const std::string& password);
```

This C++ function signature corresponds to the functionality described in your JavaScript function.
