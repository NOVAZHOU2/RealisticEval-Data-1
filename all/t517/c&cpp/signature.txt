Here's the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

using namespace std;
using json = nlohmann::json;

/**
 * Reads a JSON Lines file and returns its content as a vector of JSON objects.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the JSON Lines file.
 * @return A vector of JSON objects parsed from the file.
 * @throw runtime_error if the specified file does not exist or there is an error parsing a line in the JSON Lines file.
 */
vector<json> readJsonl(const string& file_path);
```

Note that C++ doesn't have built-in support for JSON like Python does, so we're using the `nlohmann/json` library for handling JSON data. Also, instead of raising exceptions, C++ uses `throw` keyword to handle errors.
