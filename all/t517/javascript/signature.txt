Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript function signature with comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a JSON Lines file and returns its content as a list of dictionaries.
 *
 * @param {string} file_path - The path to the JSON Lines file.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} A list of JSON objects parsed from the file.
 * @throws {Error} If the specified file does not exist or if there is an error parsing a line in the JSON Lines file.
 */
function readJsonl(file_path) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature maintains the same structure and purpose as your Python function, including the use of JSDoc comments for documentation. Note that JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for type annotations like Python, so the types are specified within the comments.
