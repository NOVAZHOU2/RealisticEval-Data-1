Sure! Below is the C++ code signature equivalent to the provided Python code signature, including comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

/**
 * @brief Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 *
 * @param graph An unordered map representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is a vector of pairs (neighbor, weight).
 * @param start The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * @return unordered_map<string, int> A map with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
 */
unordered_map<string, int> dijkstra(unordered_map<string, vector<pair<string, int>>>& graph, string start);
```

### Explanation:
- **`#include <iostream>`**: Include input-output stream library for console operations.
- **`#include <unordered_map>`**: Include unordered map library for associative container that stores elements formed by combination of a key value and a mapped value.
- **`#include <vector>`**: Include vector library for sequence containers.
- **`#include <queue>`**: Include queue library for priority queue implementation.
- **`using namespace std;`**: Use standard namespace to avoid prefixing `std::`.
- **`unordered_map<string, vector<pair<string, int>>>`**: Define a type alias for the graph representation where each node maps to a vector of pairs (neighbor, weight).
- **`unordered_map<string, int>`**: Define a type alias for the result which maps each node to its shortest distance from the start node.
- **`dijkstra(unordered_map<string, vector<pair<string, int>>>& graph, string start)`**: Function signature for Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
- **`///`**: Doxygen-style comment block to document the function.
