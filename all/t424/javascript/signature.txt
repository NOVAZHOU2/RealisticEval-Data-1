Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 * @param {Object} graph - An object representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is an array of objects {neighbor, weight}.
 * @param {string} start - The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * @returns {Object} - An object with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
 */
function dijkstra(graph, start) {
    // Priority queue for the minimum distance nodes
    const queue = [];
    // Object to store the shortest path to each node
    const shortestPaths = {};
    for (const node in graph) {
        shortestPaths[node] = Infinity;
    }
    shortestPaths[start] = 0;
    // Push the starting node with distance 0 into the queue
    queue.push({ distance: 0, node: start });
    queue.sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        // Extract the node with the smallest distance
        let current = queue.shift();
        let currentDistance = current.distance;
        let currentNode = current.node;

        // If the distance is greater than the recorded shortest path, skip processing
        if (currentDistance > shortestPaths[currentNode]) {
            continue;
        }

        // Explore neighbors
        for (const neighborInfo of graph[currentNode]) {
            const neighbor = neighborInfo.neighbor;
            const weight = neighborInfo.weight;
            const distance = currentDistance + weight;

            // Only consider this new path if it's better
            if (distance < shortestPaths[neighbor]) {
                shortestPaths[neighbor] = distance;
                // Add or update the neighbor in the priority queue
                const indexToUpdate = queue.findIndex(item => item.node === neighbor);
                if (indexToUpdate !== -1) {
                    queue[indexToUpdate].distance = distance;
                    queue.sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance);
                } else {
                    queue.push({ distance, node: neighbor });
                    queue.sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return shortestPaths;
}

// Example usage:
const graph = {
    'A': [{ neighbor: 'B', weight: 1 }, { neighbor: 'C', weight: 4 }],
    'B': [{ neighbor: 'A', weight: 1 }, { neighbor: 'C', weight: 2 }, { neighbor: 'D', weight: 5 }],
    'C': [{ neighbor: 'A', weight: 4 }, { neighbor: 'B', weight: 2 }, { neighbor: 'D', weight: 1 }],
    'D': [{ neighbor: 'B', weight: 5 }, { neighbor: 'C', weight: 1 }]
};

console.log(dijkstra(graph, 'A'));
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function signature is updated to include JSDoc comments that describe the parameters and return type.
   - The parameter types are specified using `@param` tags.
   - The return type is specified using the `@returns` tag.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comments provide clear descriptions of the parameters and return type, similar to the Python docstring.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The implementation remains the same, ensuring the logic and structure are preserved.
   - The priority queue is implemented using an array and manual sorting to maintain the order of elements based on their distances.

This JavaScript code maintains the same functionality and structure as the original Python code, with appropriate JSDoc comments for clarity.
