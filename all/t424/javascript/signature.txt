Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 * @param {Object} graph - An object representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is an array of tuples [neighbor, weight].
 * @param {string} start - The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * @returns {Object} An object with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
 */
function dijkstra(graph, start) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This preserves the purpose and structure of the Python code while adapting it to JavaScript syntax and JSDoc commenting standards.
