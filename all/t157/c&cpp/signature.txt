Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments retained from the TypeScript code:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Converts a given number of Bytes into a readable string representation with the appropriate units (Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) and keeps two decimal places.
 *
 * @param bytes - The number of bytes to be converted.
 * @returns A string representation of the size in Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.
 */
std::string bytesToSize(long long bytes);
```

This signature defines the function in C++, maintaining the comments for clarity.
