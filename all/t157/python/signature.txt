Here's how to convert the TypeScript function signature into Python while keeping the comments intact.
TypeScript Signature
typescript
/**
 * Converts a given number of Bytes into a readable string representation with the appropriate units (Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) and keeps two decimal places
 *
 * @param {number} bytes - The number of bytes to be converted.
 * @returns {string} - A string representation of the size in Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.
 */
function bytesToSize(bytes: number): string {}
Converted Python Signature
python
def bytes_to_size(bytes: int) -> str:
    """
    Converts a given number of Bytes into a readable string representation 
    with the appropriate units (Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) and keeps two decimal places.
    
    Args:
        bytes (int): The number of bytes to be converted.
        
    Returns:
        str: A string representation of the size in Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Breakdown of Changes
Function Name: The TypeScript function name bytesToSize is converted to Python's naming convention bytes_to_size (snake_case).
Parameters:
The parameter bytes: number in TypeScript is converted to bytes: int in Python, indicating that it expects an integer input.
Return Type:
The return type string in TypeScript is converted to str in Python.
Docstring:
The comments are preserved and adapted into a Python docstring format, detailing the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.
Implementation Placeholder:
The function body contains a pass statement as a placeholder for future implementation.
This signature maintains the intent and structure of the original TypeScript code while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
