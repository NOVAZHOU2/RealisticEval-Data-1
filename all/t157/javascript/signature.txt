Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature with the comments preserved, converted from TypeScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts a given number of Bytes into a readable string representation with the appropriate units (Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) and keeps two decimal places.
 *
 * @param {number} bytes - The number of bytes to be converted.
 * @returns {string} - A string representation of the size in Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.
 */
function bytesToSize(bytes) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

In this version, the type annotations have been removed, while the comments remain intact.
