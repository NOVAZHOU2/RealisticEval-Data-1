Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved, matching your TypeScript structure:

```java
/**
 * Converts a given number of Bytes into a readable string representation with the appropriate units (Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) and keeps two decimal places.
 *
 * @param bytes - The number of bytes to be converted.
 * @return - A string representation of the size in Bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.
 */
public static String bytesToSize(long bytes) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This retains the original comments and adapts the method signature to Java, using `long` for the `bytes` parameter and `String` for the return type.
