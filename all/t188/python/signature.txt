Here’s the equivalent Python code signature for the provided C++ function. The comments have been retained and converted to Python style.
Converted Python Code Signature:
python
def shell_sort(arr):
    """ 
    Implement a function that performs Shell sort on an array.
    
    :param arr: List[int] - The array to be sorted.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Changes Made:
Function Name: The C++ function shellSort is converted to shell_sort to follow Python naming conventions (PEP 8).
Parameter Type: In Python, we use a standard list for the parameter arr, and we use type hints to indicate that it is expected to be a list of integers.
Docstring Format: The C++ comment style is changed to a Python docstring, using triple quotes ("""). The @param tag is replaced with a description format that’s more commonly used in Python.
Function Body: The function body includes a pass statement, which acts as a placeholder since no implementation has been provided.
This signature can be used as a starting point for implementing the Shell sort algorithm in Python.
