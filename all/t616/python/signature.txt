To convert the provided Java function signature to a Python function signature, you'll need to make a few adjustments. Here's how the function can be represented in Python:
python
def byte_count_to_display_size(size_in_bytes: int) -> str:
    """Converts a size in bytes to a human-readable string representation.

    Args:
        size_in_bytes (int): The size in bytes to convert.

    Returns:
        str: A string representation of the size in an appropriate unit (bytes, KB, MB, GB, TB).
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Breakdown of Changes:
Function Definition:
In Java, the function is declared using the public static modifiers. In Python, there is no need for these modifiers, so we simply define the function with def.
Parameter Type:
The Java parameter type long corresponds to int in Python since Python's int can handle large integers.
Return Type:
The return type String in Java is represented as str in Python.
Docstring:
The comments from the Java code are converted into a Python docstring using triple quotes, which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
Pass Statement:
A pass statement is included as a placeholder for the function's implementation.
You can fill in the implementation of the function later according to your needs!
