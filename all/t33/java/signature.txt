Here's how you can change your Python function signature to Java:

```java
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import java.io.File;

public class Main {

    /**
     * Convert the XML file into a DataFrame, where each <sequence> tag is treated as a row record in the XML,
     * and the tag and text content of each sub-element are treated as columns and values of the DataFrame
     *
     * @param xmlFile path to the XML file
     * @return DataFrame containing the data from the XML file
     */
    public static DataFrame xmlToDataFrame(String xmlFile) {
        // Your implementation here...
    }

}
```

Please note that Java does not have built-in support for DataFrames like Python's pandas library. You would need to use an external library or create your own DataFrame implementation. Also, parsing XML in Java typically involves working with `org.w3c.dom` classes rather than simple string operations.
