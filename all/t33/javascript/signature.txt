```javascript
/**
 * Convert an XML file into a JavaScript object, treating each <sequence> tag as a row record in the XML,
 * and the tag and text content of each sub-element as properties and values of the object.
 *
 * @param {string} xmlFile - Path to the XML file.
 * @returns {Object[]} An array of objects representing the data from the XML file.

function xmlToDataFrame(xmlFile) {
    // Your implementation here...
}
```

This JavaScript function signature follows the same structure and purpose as the original Python function, including the docstring that describes what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
