Sure, here is the TypeScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Multiplies a matrix by a vector and returns the resulting vector.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 2D array representing the matrix.
 * @param vector - A 1D array representing the vector.
 * @returns The resulting vector after multiplication.
 * @throws Error if the dimensions of the matrix and vector are not compatible for multiplication.
 */
function matrixVectorMultiplication(matrix: number[][], vector: number[]): number[] {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

This TypeScript function `matrixVectorMultiplication` has the same parameters and return type as your Python function. The JSDoc comment above the function provides documentation that matches the Python docstring you provided.
