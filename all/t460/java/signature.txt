Here is the equivalent Java code with the same signature and comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Multiplies a matrix by a vector and returns the resulting vector.
 *
 * @param matrix A 2D array representing the matrix.
 * @param vector A 1D array representing the vector.
 * @return The resulting vector after multiplication.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the dimensions of the matrix and vector are not compatible for multiplication.
 */
public static double[] matrixVectorMultiplication(double[][] matrix, double[] vector) {
```

Please note that in Java, we use `double` instead of `float` for floating-point numbers, and arrays instead of lists for storing data. Also, exceptions are thrown using `throw new IllegalArgumentException("...")` instead of raising them with `raise ValueError("...")`.
