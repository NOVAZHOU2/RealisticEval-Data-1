Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python code with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Computes the output index from two given indices in the MultiVector's representation
 * of the G_n orthonormal basis.
 *
 * This function interprets the integers as little-endian bitstrings, takes their XOR,
 * and interprets the result as an integer in little-endian.
 *
 * @param {number} idx_1 - Input index 1.
 * @param {number} idx_2 - Input index 2.
 * @returns {number} The computed output index.
 */
function computeOutputIndex(idx_1, idx_2) {
}
```

In JavaScript, there isn't a direct equivalent for Python's type hints (like `int`), but you can use JSDoc style comments to describe the types of the parameters and the return value.
