```typescript
/**
 * Computes the output index from two given indices in the MultiVector's representation
 * of the G_n orthonormal basis.
 *
 * This function interprets the integers as little-endian bitstrings, takes their XOR,
 * and interprets the result as an integer in little-endian.
 *
 * @param idx_1 - Input index 1.
 * @param idx_2 - Input index 2.
 * @returns The computed output index.
 */
function computeOutputIndex(idx_1: number, idx_2: number): number {
    // Function implementation would go here
}
```

Please note that the TypeScript code does not include the actual implementation of the function, which was omitted in your Python example.
