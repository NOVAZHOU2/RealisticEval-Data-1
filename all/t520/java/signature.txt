Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Computes the output index from two given indices in the MultiVector's representation
 * of the G_n orthonormal basis.
 *
 * This function interprets the integers as little-endian bitstrings, takes their XOR,
 * and interprets the result as an integer in little-endian.
 *
 * @param idx_1 Input index 1.
 * @param idx_2 Input index 2.
 * @return The computed output index.
 */
public static int computeOutputIndex(int idx_1, int idx_2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, method signatures include the `static` keyword if the method belongs to the class itself rather than instances of the class. If the method should be part of an instance, you would remove the `static` keyword. Also, Java uses `//` for single-line comments and `/** ... */` for multi-line comments.
