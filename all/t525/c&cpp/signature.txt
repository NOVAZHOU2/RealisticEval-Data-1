Here is the C++ code signature equivalent to your Python function, with appropriate comments:

```cpp
#include <Eigen/Dense>

/**
 * @brief Flips the point cloud across a specified axis.
 *
 * @param point_cloud A N x 3 Eigen::MatrixXd representing the 3D point cloud.
 * @param axis An integer specifying the axis to flip (0 for x, 1 for y, 2 for z).
 * @return Eigen::MatrixXd A N x 3 Eigen::MatrixXd of the flipped point cloud.
 */
Eigen::MatrixXd flipPointCloud(const Eigen::MatrixXd& pointCloud, int axis);
```

This assumes you're using the Eigen library in C++, which is commonly used for matrix and vector operations like those found in NumPy for Python. Make sure to include the Eigen header file at the beginning of your source file. Also, note that unlike Python's zero-based indexing, C++ uses one-based indexing, so keep that in mind when passing `axis` values.
