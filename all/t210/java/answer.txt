Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code based on the provided C++ code. The code is organized with the package name `org.real.temp` and the class name `Answer`.

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    
    // Recursive method to compute the nth Fibonacci number
    public static int fibonacciRecursive(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        return fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) + fibonacciRecursive(n - 2);
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // Example input
        System.out.println("Fibonacci number at position " + n + " is: " + fibonacciRecursive(n));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The code begins with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;` to match the requested structure.
2. **Class Declaration**: The class is named `Answer`.
3. **Method Definition**: The `fibonacciRecursive` method is defined as `public static` to allow direct access without creating an instance of the class.
4. **Main Method**: A `main` method is added for testing the functionality, which prints the Fibonacci number for a given position. You can change the value of `n` to test different inputs.
