Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided C++ function signature and comments, adapted to JavaScript conventions:

```javascript
/**
 * Implement the Fibonacci sequence
 *
 * @param {number} n - Which Fibonacci number to calculate.
 * @return {number}
 */
function fibonacciRecursive(n) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The type declaration for the parameter `n` is indicated using JSDoc syntax.
- The return type is also documented with JSDoc for clarity.
- The function declaration syntax is adjusted to match JavaScript conventions.
