Here's the converted code signature from C++ to Python, with the comments changed to Python style:
python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    """
    Implement the Fibonacci sequence.

    :param n: Which Fibonacci number to calculate.
    :return: int
    """
    pass  # Function implementation will go here
Explanation:
The function name is changed to fibonacci_recursive, following Python naming conventions.
The C++ style comments (using /** ... */) have been converted into a Python docstring format (using triple quotes).
The parameter description is retained, and the return type is mentioned in the docstring.
The body of the function currently contains a pass statement, indicating that the function has not been implemented yet. You can replace pass with the actual implementation later.
