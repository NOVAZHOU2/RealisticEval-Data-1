Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function that computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion:
python
# Recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5  # Change this value to compute a different Fibonacci number
    print(f"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci_recursive(n)}")
Explanation:
The function is named fibonacci_recursive to follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).
The base cases and recursive logic are preserved from the C++ version.
A simple example usage is included to demonstrate how to call the function and print the result. You can change the value of n to compute different Fibonacci numbers.
