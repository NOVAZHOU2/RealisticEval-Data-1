Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java method signature along with Javadoc comments based on the provided C++ code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Parses the first line of an HTTP request response string.
 *
 * This method extracts the HTTP method, request URL, and HTTP version
 * from the given response string. The first line of the response should
 * be formatted as "METHOD URL HTTP/VERSION", followed by a CRLF sequence
 * (carriage return and line feed). If the first line does not conform
 * to this format, the method will return an empty map.
 *
 * @param response A string containing the HTTP response. It is expected
 *                 to start with a request line that includes the method,
 *                 URL, and HTTP version, ending with CRLF ("\r\n").
 *
 * @return A map containing three key-value pairs:
 *         - "method": The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
 *         - "url": The requested URL (e.g., /index.html).
 *         - "http_version": The HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
 *         If the request line is malformed or empty, the map may contain
 *         empty strings or be empty.
 *
 * @note The method does not validate the correctness of the HTTP method,
 *       URL, or version; it only parses the input string.
 */
public static Map<String, String> parseHttpRequestLine(String response) {
    // Implementation goes here
    return new HashMap<>();
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Method Signature**: Changed to a public static method, adapting the C++ reference to Java conventions.
- **Return Type**: Updated to `Map<String, String>`.
- **Javadoc Comments**: Converted C++ comments into Javadoc format, preserving the original intent and structure.
