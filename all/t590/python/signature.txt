To convert the provided C++ code signature to Python code while keeping the comments and changing the comment style to Python's format, we can follow the structure of the original code. Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code with the appropriate modifications:
python
def parse_http_request_line(response: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parses the first line of an HTTP request response string.

    This function extracts the HTTP method, request URL, and HTTP version
    from the given response string. The first line of the response should
    be formatted as "METHOD URL HTTP/VERSION", followed by a CRLF sequence
    (carriage return and line feed). If the first line does not conform
    to this format, the function will return an empty dictionary.

    Parameters:
        response (str): A string containing the HTTP response. It is expected
                        to start with a request line that includes the method,
                        URL, and HTTP version, ending with CRLF ("\r\n").

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing three key-value pairs:
              - "method": The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
              - "url": The requested URL (e.g., /index.html).
              - "http_version": The HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
              If the request line is malformed or empty, the dictionary may contain
              empty strings or be empty.

    Note:
        The function does not validate the correctness of the HTTP method,
        URL, or version; it only parses the input string.
    """
    pass
Key Changes Made:
Function Definition: Changed the C++ function signature to Python's def syntax.
Return Type: Used -> dict for the return type annotation, which is the equivalent of std::map<std::string, std::string> in C++.
Comments: Converted C++ comments (using /** ... */ and //) to Python docstrings and comments (using """ ... """ for the main description and # for inline comments).
Parameter and Return Descriptions: Changed the descriptions to fit Python conventions and clarified them as necessary.
This ensures the function retains the original intent and documentation style while adhering to Python syntax.
