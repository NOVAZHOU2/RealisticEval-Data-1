Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code signature for the provided JavaScript function signature:
JavaScript:
javascript
/**
 * Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.
 *
 * @param {string} content - The string content to check.
 * @param {number} index - The character index to find the line number for.
 * @returns {number} - The line number corresponding to the given index.
 */
function getLineNumber(content, index) {}
Python:
python
def get_line_number(content: str, index: int) -> int:
    """
    Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.

    Args:
        content (str): The string content to check.
        index (int): The character index to find the line number for.

    Returns:
        int: The line number corresponding to the given index.
    """
    pass
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function name getLineNumber in JavaScript is changed to get_line_number in Python, following the Python naming convention (snake_case).
Type Annotations:
content is annotated as a str (string), and index is annotated as an int (integer), as the function expects those types.
The return type is annotated as int because the function will return the line number as an integer.
Docstring:
A Python-style docstring is added to describe the function's purpose, arguments, and return type, following Python conventions.
This Python signature mirrors the structure and functionality described in the original JavaScript function signature.
