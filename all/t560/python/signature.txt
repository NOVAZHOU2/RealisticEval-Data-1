```python
# This Python function calculates the line number in a given string content at a specific index.

def get_line_number(content: str, index: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the line number counter
    line_number = 1
    
    # Iterate through each character in the content up to the specified index
    for i in range(index + 1):
        # Check if the current character is a newline character
        if content[i] == '\n':
            # Increment the line number counter
            line_number += 1
    
    # Return the calculated line number
    return line_number
```

This Python function `get_line_number` takes two parameters: `content`, which is a string representing the text content, and `index`, which is an integer indicating the character position within the content. The function iterates through the characters of the content up to the specified index, counting the occurrences of newline characters (`\n`) to determine the line number at that index. The initial line number is set to 1, as lines are typically numbered starting from 1 in most programming contexts.
