Sure! Here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.
 *
 * @param content - The string content to check.
 * @param index - The character index to find the line number for.
 * @return The line number corresponding to the given index.
 */
public int getLineNumber(String content, int index) {
}
```

In Java, methods must have a return type and cannot be declared with `void` if they need to return a value. Therefore, I changed the return type from `number` (which would typically be `int` or `long` in JavaScript) to `int`.
