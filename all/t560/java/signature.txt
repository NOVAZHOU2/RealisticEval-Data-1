Here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.
 *
 * @param content - The string content to check.
 * @param index - The character index to find the line number for.
 * @return The line number corresponding to the given index.
 */
public int getLineNumber(String content, int index) {
}
```

Please note that in Java, we use `int` instead of `number`, and return type is explicitly defined before the method name. Also, Java uses camelCase naming convention for methods unlike JavaScript which uses PascalCase.
