Sure! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments converted from the provided JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.
 *
 * @param content - The string content to check.
 * @param index - The character index to find the line number for.
 * @returns The line number corresponding to the given index.
 */
int getLineNumber(const std::string& content, size_t index);
```

### Explanation:
- The function signature now uses C++ types: `const std::string&` for the string and `size_t` for the index.
- The return type is specified as `int`, similar to the JavaScript function's return value.
- The comments have been preserved for clarity. 

You can now implement the function body based on this signature!
