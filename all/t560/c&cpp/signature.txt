```cpp
/**
 * Gets the line number in the content at the specified index.
 *
 * @param const std::string& content - The string content to check.
 * @param size_t index - The character index to find the line number for.
 * @return size_t - The line number corresponding to the given index.
 */
size_t getLineNumber(const std::string& content, size_t index);
```

In C++, we use `std::string` instead of JavaScript's `string`, and function return types are declared before the function name. Also, parameters are passed by reference or value depending on whether they need to be modified within the function or not. In this case, since the function does not modify the input parameters, we pass them by constant reference (`const std::string&`). The type `size_t` is used for indices and sizes, which is an unsigned integral type capable of representing the maximum size of any object that can be allocated in the system.
