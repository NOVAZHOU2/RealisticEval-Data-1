Sure! Below is the equivalent Java JUnit test case for your Python unittest test class. The package is `org.real.temp`, and the class is `Tester`. Since you didn't provide any specific assertions or logic in your Python function, I'll assume you want to write a basic test case that checks if the method runs without throwing an exception.

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class Tester {

    @Test
    public void testConvertYamlToJson() {
        // Assuming convert_yaml_to_json is a method that should run without throwing an exception
        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> convert_yaml_to_json("input.yaml", "output.json"));
    }

    private void convert_yaml_to_json(String yamlFile, String jsonFile) {
        // Your implementation of convert_yaml_to_json goes here
        // For now, we're just asserting that the method runs without throwing an exception
    }
}
```

In this Java test case:
- We use `assertDoesNotThrow` from JUnit 5 to ensure that the `convert_yaml_to_json` method does not throw any exceptions when called with valid arguments.
- The `convert_yaml_to_json` method is left empty for now, but you can add your actual implementation inside it.

Make sure you have JUnit 5 dependencies in your project. If you're using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.8.1'
}
```

This setup will allow you to run the test case using a JUnit runner in your IDE or via the command line.
