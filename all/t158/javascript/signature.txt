Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```javascript
/**
 * Extract the file extension and return it if it exists. If not, an empty string is returned
 *
 * @param {string} file_name - The full name of the file from which to extract the extension.
 * @returns {string} The file extension without the dot, or an empty string if no extension is found.
 */
function getFileExtension(file_name) {
}
```

In this version, I've removed the TypeScript type annotations, leaving the comments intact.
