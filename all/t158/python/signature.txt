Sure! Hereâ€™s how to translate the TypeScript function signature into a Python function signature while keeping the comments intact.
TypeScript Code Signature
typescript
/**
 * Extract the file extension and return it if it exists. If not, an empty string is returned
 *
 * @param {string} file_name - The full name of the file from which to extract the extension.
 * @returns {string} The file extension without the dot, or an empty string if no extension is found.
 */
function getFileExtension(file_name: string): string {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def get_file_extension(file_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract the file extension and return it if it exists. If not, an empty string is returned.

    Args:
        file_name (str): The full name of the file from which to extract the extension.

    Returns:
        str: The file extension without the dot, or an empty string if no extension is found.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The function name is converted from camelCase (getFileExtension) to snake_case (get_file_extension), which is the convention in Python.
Parameter Type:
The parameter type remains as str, just like in TypeScript.
Return Type:
The return type annotation remains the same as well, indicating the function will return a str.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are transformed into a Python docstring format, keeping the description of the function, its parameters, and return values intact.
Function Body:
A pass statement is included to indicate that this is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
This signature provides the necessary documentation and structure for the function in Python. You can now implement the function logic within the defined signature.
