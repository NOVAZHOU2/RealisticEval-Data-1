Here’s how you can translate the provided C++ code into Python code. The goal is to implement the same logic for extracting a JSON object from a string, keeping track of the braces to ensure they are balanced.
Here’s the Python version of the code:
python
def extract_json(response: str) -> str:
    start_pos = response.find('{')  # Find the position of the first '{'
    
    if start_pos == -1:  # If not found, return an empty string
        return ""
    
    brace_count = 0  # To track the balance of braces
    end_pos = start_pos  # Initialize end_pos to start_pos
    
    for i in range(start_pos, len(response)):
        if response[i] == '{':
            brace_count += 1  # Increment for every '{'
        elif response[i] == '}':
            brace_count -= 1  # Decrement for every '}'
        
        # If brace_count returns to zero, we found the complete JSON object
        if brace_count == 0:
            end_pos = i  # Set end_pos to the current position
            break  # Break out of the loop
    
    # If brace_count is not zero, it means there was an imbalance (unmatched braces)
    if brace_count != 0:
        return ""  # Return empty string if JSON is incomplete
    
    # Extract and return the substring that represents the JSON object
    return response[start_pos:end_pos + 1]

# Example usage
response = 'Some text before {"key": "value"} and some text after'
json_str = extract_json(response)
print(json_str)  # Output: {"key": "value"}
Explanation of the Python Code:
Function Definition: The function extract_json takes a string response as input.
Finding the Starting Position: It uses response.find('{') to locate the first occurrence of the opening brace.
Checking for Existence: If the opening brace isn't found, it returns an empty string.
Brace Counting: It iterates through the string, updating a brace_count variable to track how many opening and closing braces have been encountered.
Detecting the End of the JSON Object: When brace_count returns to zero, it sets end_pos to the current index, indicating that the full JSON object has been found.
Checking for Imbalance: If brace_count isn't zero after the loop, it means the braces were not balanced, and it returns an empty string.
Substring Extraction: Finally, it returns the substring from the starting to ending position inclusive.
This Python code maintains the same logic and functionality as the original C++ code.
