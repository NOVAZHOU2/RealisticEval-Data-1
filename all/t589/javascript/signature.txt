Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript version of the provided C++ function signature, including the comments converted to JavaScript style:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the first complete JSON object from a given string.
 *
 * The function looks for the first occurrence of an opening curly brace '{'
 * and searches for the corresponding closing curly brace '}'. It tracks
 * the balance of braces to ensure that the JSON object is complete.
 *
 * If a complete JSON object is found, it returns the substring that
 * represents that object. If no opening brace is found or if the braces
 * are unbalanced (i.e., incomplete), it returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param {string} response - The input string from which to extract the JSON object.
 * @return {string} A string containing the first complete JSON object, or an
 *         empty string if no complete object is found.
 */
function extractJson(response) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This version preserves the structure and intent of the original C++ code while adapting it to JavaScript syntax and conventions. Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!
