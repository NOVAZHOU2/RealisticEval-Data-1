Hereâ€™s the TypeScript conversion of the provided C++ function signature, along with the comments transformed into TypeScript-style comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts the first complete JSON object from a given string.
 *
 * The function looks for the first occurrence of an opening curly brace '{'
 * and searches for the corresponding closing curly brace '}'. It tracks
 * the balance of braces to ensure that the JSON object is complete.
 *
 * If a complete JSON object is found, it returns the substring that
 * represents that object. If no opening brace is found or if the braces
 * are unbalanced (i.e., incomplete), it returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param response The input string from which to extract the JSON object.
 * @return A string containing the first complete JSON object, or an
 *         empty string if no complete object is found.
 */
function extractJson(response: string): string {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Declaration**: Converted from C++ `std::string extract_json(const std::string& response)` to TypeScript `function extractJson(response: string): string`.
2. **Parameter Type**: Adapted the parameter type to TypeScript by specifying `: string` for the input and output types, removing the reference (`const&`) as it's not needed in TypeScript.
3. **Comment Style**: Transformed C++ comments into TypeScript-style comments, retaining the original text and formatting.
4. **Removed Memory Management**: C++ memory management conventions (like pointers or references) are not necessary in TypeScript, which handles memory automatically.
