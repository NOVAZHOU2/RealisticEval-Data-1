Here's the equivalent Java version of the given C++ function, including the appropriate Javadoc comments and Java syntax:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Utility class for extracting JSON objects from strings.
 */
public class Answer {

    /**
     * Extracts the first complete JSON object from a given string.
     *
     * The method looks for the first occurrence of an opening curly brace '{'
     * and searches for the corresponding closing curly brace '}'. It tracks
     * the balance of braces to ensure that the JSON object is complete.
     *
     * If a complete JSON object is found, it returns the substring that
     * represents that object. If no opening brace is found or if the braces
     * are unbalanced (i.e., incomplete), it returns an empty string.
     *
     * @param response The input string from which to extract the JSON object.
     * @return A string containing the first complete JSON object, or an
     *         empty string if no complete object is found.
     */
    public static String extractJson(String response) {
        int startPos = response.indexOf('{'); // Find the position of the first '{'
        if (startPos == -1) // If not found, return an empty string
            return "";

        int braceCount = 0; // To track the balance of braces
        int endPos = startPos; // Initialize endPos to startPos

        for (int i = startPos; i < response.length(); i++) {
            if (response.charAt(i) == '{') {
                braceCount++; // Increment for every '{'
            } else if (response.charAt(i) == '}') {
                braceCount--; // Decrement for every '}'
            }

            // If braceCount returns to zero, we found the complete JSON object
            if (braceCount == 0) {
                endPos = i; // Set endPos to the current position
                break; // Break out of the loop
            }
        }

        // If braceCount is not zero, it means there was an imbalance (unmatched braces)
        if (braceCount != 0) {
            return ""; // Return empty string if JSON is incomplete
        }

        // Extract and return the substring that represents the JSON object
        return response.substring(startPos, endPos + 1);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package and Class**: The Java code is placed in the `org.real.temp` package and contains a `Answer` class.
- **Javadoc Comments**: C++ comments are converted into Javadoc comments (`/** */`), providing detailed explanations for the method's functionality, parameters, and return value.
- **Method Signature**: The C++ function `extract_json` becomes a static method `extractJson` in Java, following Java naming conventions (`camelCase` for method names).
- **String Handling**: Java's `String` class methods like `indexOf`, `charAt`, and `substring` are used to perform operations similar to their C++ counterparts (`find`, `[]` access, `substr`).
- **Return Type**: `std::string` in C++ corresponds to `String` in Java.

This Java method retains the logic and structure of the original C++ function while adhering to Java's syntax and conventions.
