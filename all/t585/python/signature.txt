Hereâ€™s how to convert the TypeScript code signature into a Python code signature while retaining the comments:
TypeScript Code Signature
typescript
/**
 * Detects whether the string is in CAMEL_CASE.
 *
 * @param {string} input - The string to check.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the string is in CAMEL_CASE, otherwise false.
 */
function isCamelCase(input: string): boolean {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def is_camel_case(input: str) -> bool:
    """
    Detects whether the string is in CAMEL_CASE.

    :param input: The string to check.
    :return: True if the string is in CAMEL_CASE, otherwise False.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function name is changed from isCamelCase (CamelCase) to is_camel_case (snake_case) to follow Python naming conventions.
The parameter input is typed as str, and the return type is specified as bool.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are transformed into a docstring format, which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
The @param and @returns annotations are converted to :param and :return, which is the convention in Python docstrings.
Placeholder Implementation:
The function body contains pass, which serves as a placeholder indicating that the implementation will be added later.
This Python code signature accurately reflects the original TypeScript signature while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
