Hereâ€™s how you can translate the given C++ code into Python. The Python version uses lists to represent the matrix and has similar logic for calculating the minimum number of changes needed to make the matrix symmetric:
python
def min_changes_to_symmetric(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    min_changes = 0
    # Traverse only the upper triangle of the matrix, excluding the diagonal
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # If the corresponding elements are not equal, they need to be changed
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[j][i]:
                min_changes += 1
                # Optionally, you can change matrix[i][j] to matrix[j][i] or vice versa to make it symmetric
                # Uncomment the line below if you want to actually modify the matrix
                # matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i]
    return min_changes

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['b', 'a', 'd'],
    ['c', 'd', 'a']
]

print(min_changes_to_symmetric(matrix))  # Output: number of changes needed
Explanation of the Code:
Function Definition: The function min_changes_to_symmetric takes a 2D list (matrix) as input.
Matrix Size: The size of the matrix n is determined using len(matrix).
Change Counter: A variable min_changes is initialized to count the number of changes needed.
Looping Through the Matrix: Two nested loops iterate through the upper triangle of the matrix (excluding the diagonal):
The outer loop goes from 0 to n-1.
The inner loop goes from i + 1 to n, ensuring that we only check the upper triangle.
Condition Check: Inside the nested loops, the code checks if the elements matrix[i][j] and matrix[j][i] are not equal:
If they are not equal, it increments the min_changes counter.
Return Value: The function returns the total count of changes needed to make the matrix symmetric.
You can call the function with a test matrix to see the result. Adjust the matrix values as needed for testing different cases.
