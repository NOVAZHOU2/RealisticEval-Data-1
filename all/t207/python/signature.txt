Here's how you can convert the C++ code signature to Python code, keeping the comments and converting them to Python style:
python
def min_changes_to_symmetric(matrix):
    """
    Convert a given square character matrix into a symmetric matrix and calculate the minimum number of character replacements required to achieve symmetry.

    :param matrix: A list of lists of characters representing the matrix to be analyzed.
    :return: The minimum number of element changes required to make the matrix symmetric.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
Explanation:
Function Definition: The function min_changes_to_symmetric is defined with a parameter matrix.
Docstring: A Python docstring is used to describe the function, including the purpose, parameters, and return value. This is similar to the C++ comments but follows Python conventions.
Placeholder: A pass statement is included to indicate that this is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the function.
You can then implement the logic of the function inside the min_changes_to_symmetric function body. If you need the implementation as well, just let me know!
