Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature for the provided C++ code, along with the adapted comments. The JavaScript version will follow the same structure while using JavaScript conventions.

```javascript
/**
 * Convert a given square character matrix into a symmetric matrix and calculate the minimum number of character replacements required to achieve symmetry.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<string>>} matrix - A 2D array of characters representing the matrix to be analyzed.
 * @return {number} - The minimum number of element changes required to make the matrix symmetric.
 */
function minChangesToSymmetric(matrix) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Adaptations:
1. **Function Declaration**: The C++ function is replaced with a JavaScript function declaration using the `function` keyword.
2. **Type Annotations**: 
   - The parameter type `vector<vector<char>>&` is represented as `Array<Array<string>>` in JavaScript, reflecting that we are dealing with a 2D array of strings (characters).
   - The return type `int` is represented as `number` in JavaScript.
3. **Comments**: The C++ comment style is preserved but formatted to fit JavaScript documentation style, using JSDoc conventions. 

You can implement the function's logic inside the body of the JavaScript function as needed.
