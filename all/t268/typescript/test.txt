Certainly! Here is the equivalent Jest test suite in TypeScript for the provided Python unittest class. The test cases will use Jest's assertion methods to ensure the functionality and logic are preserved.

### TypeScript Code with Jest Tests

First, ensure you have Jest and TypeScript set up in your project. You can install them using npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

Add the necessary Jest configuration to your `tsconfig.json` or `jest.config.js`.

#### Jest Test Suite

```typescript
import { canCompleteCircuit } from './canCompleteCircuit'; // Import the function from the TypeScript file

describe('canCompleteCircuit', () => {
    it('should return the correct starting index for a single station', () => {
        const gas = [5];
        const cost = [4];
        const expected = 0;
        expect(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)).toBe(expected);
    });

    it('should return -1 for an impossible single station', () => {
        const gas = [4];
        const cost = [5];
        const expected = -1;
        expect(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)).toBe(expected);
    });

    it('should return the correct starting index for two stations', () => {
        const gas = [1, 2];
        const cost = [2, 1];
        const expected = 1;
        expect(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)).toBe(expected);
    });

    it('should return the correct starting index for a circular route', () => {
        const gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];
        const expected = 3;
        expect(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)).toBe(expected);
    });

    it('should return -1 for an impossible circular route', () => {
        const gas = [2, 3, 4];
        const cost = [3, 4, 3];
        const expected = -1;
        expect(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)).toBe(expected);
    });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Function**: Import the `canCompleteCircuit` function from the TypeScript file where it is defined.
2. **Describe Block**: Use the `describe` block to group the test cases under the `canCompleteCircuit` function.
3. **Test Cases**: Each `it` block represents a test case. The `expect` method is used to assert the expected outcome.
4. **Assertion Methods**: The `toBe` method is used to check equality, which is equivalent to `assertEqual` in Python's `unittest`.

### TypeScript Implementation of `canCompleteCircuit`

Ensure you have the `canCompleteCircuit` function implemented in TypeScript. Here is the implementation again for completeness:

```typescript
/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param gas - An array of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param cost - An array of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas: number[], cost: number[]): number {
    const n = gas.length;
    let totalGas = 0;
    let totalCost = 0;
    let tank = 0;
    let startIndex = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalGas += gas[i];
        totalCost += cost[i];
        tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

        if (tank < 0) {  // If tank becomes negative, update startIndex and reset tank
            startIndex = i + 1;
            tank = 0;
        }
    }

    return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
}

export { canCompleteCircuit };
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, add the following configurations to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.0.0",
    "@types/jest": "^27.0.0",
    "ts-jest": "^27.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^16.0.0"
  }
}
```

Run the tests using:

```sh
npm test
```

This setup ensures that the tests are executed correctly and that the functionality of the `canCompleteCircuit` function is thoroughly tested.
