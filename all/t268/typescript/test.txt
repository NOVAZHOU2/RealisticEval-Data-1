To solve this task, we will create a TypeScript test class using Jest that replicates the functionality of the given Python unittest test class for the `canCompleteCircuit` function. We need to define the `canCompleteCircuit` function and write Jest tests for it. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Define the `canCompleteCircuit` function in TypeScript.**
2. **Create a Jest test suite with test cases that replicate the Python unittest test cases.**

Here is the TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from '@jest/globals';

/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param gas - List of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param cost - List of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas: number[], cost: number[]): number {
    const n = gas.length;
    let totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, startStation = 0, currentGas = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalGas += gas[i];
        totalCost += cost[i];
        currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];

        // If current gas becomes negative, update the start station and reset current gas
        if (currentGas < 0) {
            startStation = i + 1;
            currentGas = 0;
        }
    }

    // If total gas is less than total cost, no solution exists
    return totalGas < totalCost ? -1 : startStation;
}

describe('canCompleteCircuit', () => {
    it('should return -1 when the circuit cannot be completed', () => {
        expect(canCompleteCircuit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 1, 2])).toBe(-1);
    });

    it('should return 3 when the circuit can be completed starting at index 3', () => {
        expect(canCompleteCircuit([2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 3])).toBe(3);
    });

    it('should return 0 when the circuit can be completed starting at index 0', () => {
        expect(canCompleteCircuit([5, 1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 4, 1, 5, 1])).toBe(0);
    });

    it('should handle empty arrays', () => {
        expect(canCompleteCircuit([], [])).toBe(-1);
    });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `canCompleteCircuit` function takes two arrays, `gas` and `cost`, and returns the starting index or `-1` if the circuit cannot be completed.
   - It calculates the total gas and cost, and iterates through the stations to find a valid starting point.

2. **Test Cases:**
   - Each `it` block contains a test case that uses `expect` to assert the expected output of the function.
   - Test cases include scenarios where the circuit can be completed and where it cannot.

This TypeScript code uses Jest's `describe` and `it` blocks along with `expect` assertions to replicate the functionality and logic of the Python unittest test cases.
