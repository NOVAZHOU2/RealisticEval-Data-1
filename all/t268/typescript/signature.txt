Sure! Here is the TypeScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param gas - List of numbers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param cost - List of numbers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas: number[], cost: number[]): number {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `number[]` to represent lists of numbers, and the function signature remains similar to Python. The docstring is preserved using JSDoc comments.
