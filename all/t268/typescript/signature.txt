Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function:

```typescript
import { number } from "prop-types";

/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param gas - Array of numbers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param cost - Array of numbers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas: number[], cost: number[]): number {
    // Implementation goes here
    // Note: The actual logic needs to be implemented based on the Python function's body.
    return -1; // Placeholder return
}

// Example usage
// const result = canCompleteCircuit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]);
// console.log(result); // Expected output depends on the implementation
```

Note that the actual implementation of the `canCompleteCircuit` function is not provided here, as it would depend on the Python function's body. You should fill in the logic based on the original Python function.
