Sure! Below is the C++ code with the same function signature and comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param gas A vector of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param cost A vector of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @return The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
int canCompleteCircuit(const std::vector<int>& gas, const std::vector<int>& cost) {
    int totalGas = 0;
    int currentGas = 0;
    int startStation = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < gas.size(); ++i) {
        totalGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
        currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];

        // If current gas becomes negative, reset the start station
        if (currentGas < 0) {
            startStation = i + 1;
            currentGas = 0;
        }
    }

    // If total gas is negative, it means we cannot complete the circuit
    if (totalGas < 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    return startStation;
}
```

This C++ function `canCompleteCircuit` takes two vectors of integers representing the gas and cost at each station, respectively. It returns the starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise, it returns -1. The function includes the necessary logic to determine the starting point based on the given conditions.
