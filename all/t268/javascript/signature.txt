Here is your JavaScript version with the same function signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param {number[]} gas - Array of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param {number[]} cost - Array of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns {number} - The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) {
    
}
```

Please note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for type hinting like Python. It's common practice to use JSDoc style comments to document the types of parameters and return values in JavaScript.
