Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
 * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
 *
 * @param {number[]} gas - List of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
 * @param {number[]} cost - List of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
 * @returns {number} The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) {
    const n = gas.length;
    let totalGas = 0;
    let totalCost = 0;
    let tank = 0;
    let startIndex = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalGas += gas[i];
        totalCost += cost[i];
        tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

        if (tank < 0) {  // If tank becomes negative, update startIndex and reset tank
            startIndex = i + 1;
            tank = 0;
        }
    }

    return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **JSDoc Comments**:
  - The JSDoc comment block provides a description of the function.
  - It specifies the parameters (`gas` and `cost`) with their types (`number[]`).
  - It specifies the return type (`number`).

- **Function Signature**:
  - The function `canCompleteCircuit` takes two parameters: `gas` and `cost`.
  - The function body remains the same as the original Python code.

This ensures that the JavaScript code is well-documented and follows the same logic and structure as the original Python code.
