Sure, here is the equivalent Java method with the appropriate Java-style comments and type conversions:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class CircuitCompletionChecker {

    /**
     * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
     * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
     *
     * @param gas List of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
     * @param cost List of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
     * @return The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
     */
    public static int canCompleteCircuit(List<Integer> gas, List<Integer> cost) {
        // Implementation goes here
        return -1; // Placeholder for the actual implementation
    }
}
```

In this Java version, the `canCompleteCircuit` method is part of a class named `CircuitCompletionChecker`. The method takes two `List<Integer>` parameters, `gas` and `cost`, and returns an `int`. The Javadoc comments have been added to describe the method, its parameters, and its return value.
