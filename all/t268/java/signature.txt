Here is the equivalent Java code with the same signature and comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Determines if there exists a starting gas station's index where you can travel
     * around the circuit once in a clockwise direction.
     *
     * @param gas  List of integers representing the amount of gas at each station.
     * @param cost List of integers representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next.
     * @return The starting gas station's index if the circuit can be completed, otherwise -1.
     */
    public static int canCompleteCircuit(List<Integer> gas, List<Integer> cost) {
        return -1;
    }
}
```

Please note that the implementation of the method `canCompleteCircuit` is not provided here because it depends on the specific logic of your program. In the current state, the method simply returns `-1`.
