Here is the equivalent Java code organized with the package name `org.real.temp` and the class name `Answer`, following Java's syntax and conventions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int[] gas = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] cost = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost));
    }

    /**
     * Determines if there is a starting gas station index at which a car can complete the circuit.
     *
     * @param gas  An array representing the amount of gas at each station.
     * @param cost An array representing the cost of gas to travel to the next station.
     * @return The starting gas station index or -1 if it's not possible to complete the circuit.
     */
    public static int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n = gas.length;
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, tank = 0, startIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

            if (tank < 0) {  // If tank becomes negative, update startIndex and reset tank
                startIndex = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }

        return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package Declaration**: The package name `org.real.temp` is declared at the beginning.
- **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` contains the main method and the `canCompleteCircuit` method.
- **Method Signature**: The `canCompleteCircuit` method takes two integer arrays as parameters and returns an integer.
- **Variables**: Local variables are declared and initialized as per the logic in the Python code.
- **Logic**: The logic remains the same, including the loop and conditional statements.

This Java code follows the same functionality and logic as the provided Python code but adapts to Java's syntax and conventions.
