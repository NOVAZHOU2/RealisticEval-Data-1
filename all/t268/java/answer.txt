Below is the Java code equivalent to the provided Python code, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. It includes the necessary imports and adheres to Java's syntax and conventions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int[] gas = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] cost = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost));
    }

    /**
     * Determines if there is a starting gas station index at which a car can complete the circuit.
     * 
     * @param gas An array representing the amount of gas at each station.
     * @param cost An array representing the cost of gas to travel from each station to the next one.
     * @return The starting gas station index if the car can complete the circuit, or -1 otherwise.
     */
    public static int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n = gas.length;
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, tank = 0, startIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

            if (tank < 0) {  // If tank becomes negative, update startIndex and reset tank
                startIndex = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }

        return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package Declaration**: The code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
- **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined.
- **Main Method**: A `main` method is included for testing purposes.
- **Method Signature**: The `canCompleteCircuit` method takes two integer arrays (`gas` and `cost`) as parameters and returns an integer.
- **Logic**: The logic remains the same as the Python code, including the loop to calculate `totalGas`, `totalCost`, and `tank`, and updating `startIndex` when the tank becomes negative.
- **Return Statement**: The method returns `startIndex` if `totalGas` is greater than or equal to `totalCost`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

This Java code maintains the functionality and logic of the original Python code while adhering to Java's syntax and conventions.
