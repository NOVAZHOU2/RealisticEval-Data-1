Below is the Java code that converts the given Python unittest class into an equivalent JUnit test class:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Tester {

    // Method to check if the circuit can be completed
    private int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        // Implementation of the method similar to Python's function
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, start = 0, gasInTank = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            gasInTank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            // If one couldn't get to the next station from i, pick up the start and reset state
            if (gasInTank < 0) {
                start = i + 1;
                gasInTank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // Return -1 if total gas is less than total cost, indicating it's not possible to complete the circuit
        if (totalGas < totalCost) return -1;
        // Otherwise, return the start index
        return start;
    }

    @Test
    public void testCanCompleteCircuit() {
        // Test case 1: Circuit can be completed starting from index 3
        assertEquals(3, canCompleteCircuit(new int[]{1,2,3,4,5}, new int[]{3,4,5,1,2}));

        // Test case 2: Circuit cannot be completed, so return -1
        assertEquals(-1, canCompleteCircuit(new int[]{2,3,4}, new int[]{3,4,3}));

        // Add more test cases as needed
    }
}
```

This Java code includes the `canCompleteCircuit` method, which is the equivalent of the Python function. It also includes a JUnit test method, `testCanCompleteCircuit`, which uses assertions to verify the correctness of the method with different sets of inputs. The test method uses `assertEquals` to compare the expected result with the actual result returned by the `canCompleteCircuit` method.
