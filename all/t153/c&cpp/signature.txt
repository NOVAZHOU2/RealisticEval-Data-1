Here's the C++ code signature with comments preserved, adapted from your TypeScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * The input hash string is compressed into a number letter string of length no less than 5
 *
 * @param hash - The hash string to be compressed.
 * @returns A compressed string representation of the hash.
 */
std::string compressHash(const std::string& hash) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

In this code, the `hash` parameter is a `std::string`, which you can replace with a suitable type if you are working with binary data. The function's return type is `std::string`, corresponding to the TypeScript return type.
