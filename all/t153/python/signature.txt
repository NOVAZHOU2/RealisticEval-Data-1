Certainly! Below is the Python code signature equivalent to the provided TypeScript code signature, including the comments.
Python Code Signature
python
def compress_hash(hash_bytes: bytes) -> str:

    :param hash_bytes: The hash buffer to be compressed.
    :return: A compressed string representation of the hash.
    """
    # Implementation goes here...
Explanation of the Code Signature
The function name is compress_hash, which follows the Python naming conventions.
The parameter hash_bytes is typed as bytes, equivalent to Buffer in TypeScript.
The return type is specified as str, indicating that the function returns a string.
The docstring includes the description of the function, its parameters, and its return value, similar to the TypeScript comments.
