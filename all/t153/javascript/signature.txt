Hereâ€™s the JavaScript version of the function signature, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * The input hash buffer is compressed into a number letter string of length no less than 5
 *
 * @param {Buffer} hash - The hash buffer to be compressed.
 * @returns {string} A compressed string representation of the hash.
 */
function compressHash(hash) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
``` 

This removes the TypeScript-specific types while preserving the comments.
