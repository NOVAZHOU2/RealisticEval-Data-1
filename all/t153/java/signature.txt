Here's the Java code signature with the comments retained:

```java
/**
 * The input hash buffer is compressed into a number letter string of length no less than 5
 *
 * @param hash - The hash buffer to be compressed.
 * @return A compressed string representation of the hash.
 */
public static String compressHash(ByteBuffer hash) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The comments are unchanged from the TypeScript version, ensuring that the purpose of the method and parameters is clear.
- The method signature is updated to Java's syntax, with `ByteBuffer` used in place of TypeScript's `Buffer`.
