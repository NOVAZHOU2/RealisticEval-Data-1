Here's the provided C++ code signature converted to Python, with comments adjusted to Python's style:
python
# Node structure for linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.data = val  # Data value of the node
        self.next = None  # Pointer to the next node in the linked list

# Queue class
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Pointer to the front of the queue
        self.tail = None  # Pointer to the end of the queue

    # Destructor to clean up the queue
    def __del__(self):
        while not self.is_empty():
            self.dequeue()

    # Function to check if the queue is empty
    def is_empty(self):
        pass

    # Function to add an element to the end of the queue
    def enqueue(self, value):
        pass

    # Function to remove and return the front element of the queue
    def dequeue(self):
        pass

    # Function to get the front element without removing it
    def front(self):
        pass
Explanation of Changes:
Class and Method Definitions: The class and method definitions have been adapted to Python syntax, using def for methods.
Comments: C++ style comments (//) have been replaced with Python style comments (#).
Destructor: In Python, the destructor method is defined as __del__.
Method Names: Method names in Python are typically written in snake_case, but since they are kept the same as in C++, they remain in camelCase as per the original code.
Data Members: The Node class constructor has been adapted to Python's __init__ method, and the queue's head and tail are initialized in the __init__ method of the Queue class.
You can now implement the methods is_empty, enqueue, dequeue, and front according to your requirements!
