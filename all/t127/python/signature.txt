To translate the provided JavaScript code signature into Python, we will convert the function declaration and the parameters into Python syntax. The comments will also be adapted to Python's docstring format. Below is the equivalent Python code signature:
python
def separate_octave_and_root(midi_notes):
    """
    Splits a list of MIDI note numbers into separate lists of octaves and root notes.

    Args:
        midi_notes (list of int): A list of MIDI note numbers.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing lists of octaves and root notes.
    """
    pass
Explanation:
Function Name: The JavaScript function separateOctaveAndRoot is converted to separate_octave_and_root to follow Python's naming convention (PEP 8).
Parameter Type: The parameter midiNotes in JavaScript is changed to midi_notes in Python.
Docstring Format: The comments in JavaScript are replaced with a docstring that explains the function, its parameters, and its return type using the Args and Returns sections.
Placeholder: The pass statement is used as a placeholder in Python, indicating that the function does not currently implement any logic.
This code signature can be filled in later with the actual logic to split MIDI notes into octaves and root notes.
