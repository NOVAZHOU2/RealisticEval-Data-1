Here’s the Java method signature along with the comments converted from the JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Splits a list of MIDI note numbers into separate lists of octaves and root notes.
 *
 * @param midiNotes An array of MIDI note numbers.
 * @returns An object containing lists of octaves and root notes.
 */
public NoteSeparation separateOctaveAndRoot(int[] midiNotes) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

In this Java signature, I used `NoteSeparation` as the return type, assuming it’s the class used to encapsulate the result. The comments were adapted to fit Java's documentation style.
