Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a log file containing JSON entries and extracts training loss and test accuracy.
 * Json entries such as {"test_acc1": 88.5, "train_loss": 0.75}
 * @param {string} logFilePath - The path to the log file to be read.
 * @returns {Object} An object containing two arrays:
 *     - trainLossList (Array): An array of training loss values extracted from the log.
 *     - testAcc1List (Array): An array of test accuracy values extracted from the log.
 */
function readLog(logFilePath) {
    
}
```
Please note that in JavaScript, there's no built-in way to directly read files like in Python, so you would need to use an asynchronous file reading method provided by Node.js or a similar library if you're working in a browser environment. Also, error handling should be added to handle cases where the file might not exist or other I/O errors occur.
