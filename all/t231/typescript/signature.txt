Here is how you can convert the Python function signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads a log file containing JSON entries and extracts training loss and test accuracy.
 * Json entries such as {"test_acc1": 88.5, "train_loss": 0.75}
 * 
 * @param logFilePath - The path to the log file to be read.
 * @returns A tuple containing two arrays:
 *          - trainLossList: An array of training loss values extracted from the log.
 *          - testAcc1List: An array of test accuracy values extracted from the log.
 */
```

In TypeScript, we use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `@param` followed by a parameter name to describe each argument. We also use `@returns` to describe the return value of the function. Unlike Python, TypeScript doesn't have built-in support for type hints in docstrings like Python does with Google-style docstrings, so we'll use JSDoc style comments which are widely used in JavaScript/TypeScript communities.
