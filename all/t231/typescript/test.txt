To convert the given Python unittest test class to a TypeScript test case using Jest, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Jest if you haven't already. You can do this by running `npm install --save-dev jest`.
2. Create a new TypeScript file for your tests, e.g., `readLog.test.ts`.
3. Write the equivalent Jest test cases in TypeScript.

Here's an example of how you might write the Jest test cases for the `read_log` function:

```typescript
import { read_log } from './path-to-your-read-log-file'; // Adjust the import path accordingly

describe('read_log', () => {
  it('should return empty arrays when the log file is empty', async () => {
    const logFilePath = 'path/to/empty/logfile.log';
    const [trainLossList, testAcc1List] = await read_log(logFilePath);
    expect(trainLossList).toEqual([]);
    expect(testAcc1List).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('should correctly extract training loss and test accuracy from the log file', async () => {
    const logFilePath = 'path/to/logfile.log'; // Adjust the path to your actual log file
    const [trainLossList, testAcc1List] = await read_log(logFilePath);

    // Assuming the log file contains at least one entry like {"test_acc1": 88.5, "train_loss": 0.75}
    expect(trainLossList).toContain(0.75);
    expect(testAcc1List).toContain(88.5);
  });
});
```

Make sure to adjust the import statement and the paths according to your project structure. This example assumes that the `read_log` function returns a promise, which is typical for asynchronous operations in Node.js or any other environment where asynchronous I/O is used. If your `read_log` function does not return a promise, you will need to modify the test cases accordingly.
