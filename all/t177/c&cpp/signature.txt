Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature for the provided Python function, along with the comments and docstrings converted to C++ format:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/* 
 * Generates a 16-byte random salt value, hashes the provided password with that salt
 * using the SHA-256 hash algorithm, and returns the combined salt and hashed password.
 *
 * Args:
 *     password (const std::string&): The password to be hashed.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     std::vector<uint8_t>: A byte array containing the salt followed by the hashed password.
 */
std::vector<uint8_t> hash_password_with_salt(const std::string& password);
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Return Type**: In C++, the return type `bytes` from Python is represented as `std::vector<uint8_t>`.

2. **Type Annotations**: The Python type annotations have been converted to C++ types:
   - `str` becomes `const std::string&` for efficient passing of string references.
   - `-> bytes` becomes `std::vector<uint8_t>` for the return type.

3. **Comments and Docstrings**: The Python docstring has been transformed into C++ comments, formatted to adhere to C++ documentation standards using `/* */` for multi-line comments.

This ensures that the original purpose and structure are preserved while adapting to C++ syntax.
