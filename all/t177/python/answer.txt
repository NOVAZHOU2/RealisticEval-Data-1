Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Java class Answer into a Python class that replicates its functionality. This Python version will include methods for generating a random salt, hashing a password with that salt using SHA-256, and a testing function to demonstrate its usage.

Explanation
Imports: The os module is used to generate random bytes, and hashlib is used for SHA-256 hashing.
Class Structure: The Python class Answer has static methods to match the Java class's functionality.
Random Salt Generation:
generate_random_salt(length: int): Uses os.urandom(length) to generate secure random bytes.
Password Hashing:
hash_with_sha256(password: str, salt: bytes): This method hashes the password by first updating the SHA-256 hash object with the salt and then the password.
Combining Salt and Hashed Password:
The method hash_password_with_salt(password: str) combines the salt and hashed password into a single byte array, similar to the original Java method.
Main Method: The main() method tests the functionality by hashing a sample password and printing the result.
Testing the Code
To run the code, simply copy it into a Python environment or script file and execute it. The output will show the generated salt combined with the hashed password.
