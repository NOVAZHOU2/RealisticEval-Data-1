To convert the Java function signature provided into Python, we'll need to take into account a few differences in syntax and data types between Java and Python.
Here’s the Java function signature you provided:
java
/** 
 * Generates a 16-byte random salt value, hashes the provided password with that salt 
 * using the SHA-256 hash algorithm, and returns the combined salt and hashed password. 
 *
 * @param password The password to be hashed. 
 * @return A byte array containing the salt followed by the hashed password. 
 * @throws NoSuchAlgorithmException If the SHA-256 algorithm is not available. 
 */
public static byte[] hashPasswordWithSalt(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {}
Equivalent Python Function Signature
In Python, we don't have checked exceptions like Java, so we won't explicitly declare exceptions. Instead, if an error occurs (e.g., if the hashing algorithm is not available), we can handle it within the function or let it raise an exception. Also, we use bytes for byte arrays.
Here’s how the function signature can be rewritten in Python:
python
import hashlib
import os

def hash_password_with_salt(password: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Generates a 16-byte random salt value, hashes the provided password with that salt
    using the SHA-256 hash algorithm, and returns the combined salt and hashed password.

    :param password: The password to be hashed.
    :return: A byte array containing the salt followed by the hashed password.
    """
Explanation
Function Name and Parameters:
The function name follows the Python convention of using underscores (snake_case).
The parameter password is defined with a type hint str, indicating it is a string.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated with -> bytes, showing that the function will return a byte array.
Docstring:
The comments from Java are converted into a docstring for documentation purposes, explaining the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return type.
Full Implementation Example
If you're looking for a full implementation of the function, including the salt generation and hashing, here’s a complete example:
python
import hashlib
import os

def hash_password_with_salt(password: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Generates a 16-byte random salt value, hashes the provided password with that salt
    using the SHA-256 hash algorithm, and returns the combined salt and hashed password.

    :param password: The password to be hashed.
    :return: A byte array containing the salt followed by the hashed password.
    """
    # Generate a 16-byte random salt
    salt = os.urandom(16)

    # Create a SHA-256 hash of the password combined with the salt
    hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(salt + password.encode()).digest()

    # Combine the salt and the hashed password
    return salt + hashed_password
Key Components of the Implementation
os.urandom(16): Generates a 16-byte random salt.
hashlib.sha256(...): Hashes the combined salt and password.
.digest(): Returns the hash as bytes.
Combining: The salt and hashed password are concatenated before returning.
This implementation should work similarly to the Java version you provided.
