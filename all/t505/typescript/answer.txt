Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for your Python function:

```typescript
function camelToSnake(camelStr: string): string {
    /**
     * Convert a CamelCase string to snake_case.
     *
     * @param {string} camelStr - The CamelCase string to convert.
     * @returns {string} - The converted snake_case string.
     */
    
    return camelStr.replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1_$2').toLowerCase();
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've used a regular expression to find all occurrences of a lowercase letter followed immediately by an uppercase letter and replaced them with that lowercase letter followed by an underscore and then the uppercase letter. After replacing these instances, I've also converted the entire string to lower case. This effectively transforms a CamelCase string into a snake_case string.
