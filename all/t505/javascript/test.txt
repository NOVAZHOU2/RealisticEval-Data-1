Here's how you can translate your Python unittest test class into a Jest test case using JavaScript:

```javascript
const camelToSnake = require('./camelToSnake'); // Assuming camelToSnake is exported from a file named camelToSnake.js

describe('camelToSnake function', () => {
  it('converts CamelCase strings to snake_case', () => {
    expect(camelToSnake('CamelCaseString')).toBe('camel_case_string');
    expect(camelToSnake('AnotherExampleString')).toBe('another_example_string');
    // Add more tests if needed
  });
});
```

In this example, `camelToSnake` is assumed to be exported from a file named `camelToSnake.js`. If it's defined in another way or in the same file, you'll need to adjust the import statement accordingly.
