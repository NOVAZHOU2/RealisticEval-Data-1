Sure, here is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Converts a CamelCase string to snake_case.
 *
 * @param camelStr The CamelCase string to convert.
 * @return The converted snake_case string.
 */
public static String camelToSnake(String camelStr) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that in Java, we use Javadoc style comments for documentation. The `@param` tag is used to describe method parameters, and the `@return` tag is used to describe what the method returns. The method itself should be defined within a class or interface.
