Here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <regex>

/**
 * Converts a CamelCase string to snake_case.
 *
 * @param camelStr The CamelCase string to convert.
 * @return The converted snake_case string.
 */
std::string camelToSnake(const std::string& camelStr);
```

Please note that in C++, it's common practice to use `snake_case` for variable and function names, while `CamelCase` is typically used for class names. However, if you want to keep the function name as `camelToSnake`, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.
