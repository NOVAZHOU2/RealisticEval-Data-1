Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ unit test case using Catch2 for the `camel_to_snake` function you provided. Catch2 is a modern, C++-based testing framework that is easy to use and expressive.

First, make sure you have Catch2 installed in your project. If you're using a package manager like vcpkg or conan, you can install it easily. For simplicity, I'll assume you have it included in your project manually.

Here's how you can write the C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <string>

// Function to be tested
std::string camelToSnake(const std::string& camelStr) {
    std::string result;
    for (char c : camelStr) {
        if (isupper(c)) {
            result += "_";
            result += tolower(c);
        } else {
            result += c;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

TEST_CASE("Camel to Snake Conversion", "[camel_to_snake]") {
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("helloWorld") == "hello_world");
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("thisIsATestString") == "this_is_a_test_string");
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("oneTwoThree") == "one_two_three");
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("singleWord") == "single_word");
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("") == "");
    REQUIRE(camelToSnake("already_snake_case") == "already_snake_case");
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Catch2 Header**: We include the Catch2 header file at the beginning of our source file.
2. **Function Implementation**: The `camelToSnake` function is implemented similarly to your Python function.
3. **Test Case**: We define a test case using the `TEST_CASE` macro from Catch2. The first argument is the name of the test case, and the second argument is a tag that can be used to filter tests.
4. **Assertions**: We use the `REQUIRE` macro to assert that the output of `camelToSnake` matches the expected result.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need to compile your source file with a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later (since Catch2 requires C++17 features). Here's an example using g++:

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -o test_camel_to_snake test_camel_to_snake.cpp
./test_camel_to_snake
```

This will execute the test cases and provide you with the results.
