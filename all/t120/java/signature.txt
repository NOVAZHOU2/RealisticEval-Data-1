Here's the Java code signature with comments converted from your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Extract table data from an HTML document and return the data organized as a two-dimensional list.
 * @param html The HTML content as a String.
 * @return A List of List of Strings representing the table data.
 */
public static List<List<String>> extractCSVDataFromHTML(String html) {
    
}
```

This retains the structure and intent of your original JavaScript function, adapting it to Java's syntax and conventions.
