Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature with the comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Extract table data from a document object containing HTML tables and return the data organized as a two-dimensional array.
 * @param {Document} document - The document object to extract data from.
 * @returns {string[][]} The extracted data organized as a two-dimensional array.
 */
function extractCSVDataFromHTML(document: Document): string[][] {
    
}
```

In this version, I've added a return type annotation and specified the type of the `document` parameter.
