Certainly! Let's convert the given Python function signature and comments into equivalent JavaScript syntax, including JSDoc comments for proper documentation.

Here is the converted JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * Determines if two values are siblings in a binary tree represented as an array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} tree - the binary tree level-order representation
 * @param {number} val1 - the first value to check for sibling relationship
 * @param {number} val2 - the second value to check for sibling relationship
 * @returns {boolean} - true if val1 and val2 are siblings, false otherwise
 */
function areSiblings(tree, val1, val2) {
    if (val1 === val2) {
        return false;  // A node cannot be a sibling to itself
    }

    try {
        // Find indices of the values
        const index1 = tree.indexOf(val1);
        const index2 = tree.indexOf(val2);

        // Check if they have the same parent
        return (index1 - 1) >>> 1 === (index2 - 1) >>> 1 && index1 !== index2;
    } catch (error) {
        // One of the values is not in the tree
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comment block at the beginning provides detailed documentation for the function.
   - Each parameter and the return type are documented with their respective types and descriptions.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `areSiblings` is defined with the same parameters as the Python function.
   - The parameter types are annotated using JSDoc comments.

3. **Equality Check**:
   - The initial check for equality (`val1 === val2`) ensures that a node cannot be a sibling to itself.

4. **Index Finding**:
   - The `indexOf` method is used to find the indices of `val1` and `val2` in the `tree` array.

5. **Parent Check**:
   - The bitwise unsigned right shift operator (`>>>`) is used to calculate the parent index, ensuring it works correctly for non-negative numbers.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - A `try-catch` block is used to handle the case where one of the values is not found in the `tree` array, which would throw an error when calling `indexOf`.

This JavaScript function preserves the same logic and functionality as the original Python function, with appropriate JSDoc comments for documentation.
