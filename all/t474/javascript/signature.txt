Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript while keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Determines if two values are siblings in a binary tree represented as an array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} tree - The binary tree level-order representation
 * @param {number} val1 - First value to check for sibling relationship
 * @param {number} val2 - Second value to check for sibling relationship
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function areSiblings(tree, val1, val2) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments to document functions, similar to Python's docstrings. The `@param` tag is used to describe each parameter, including its type, and the `@returns` tag specifies the return type of the function. Note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for type annotations like TypeScript, so the types are specified using JSDoc syntax.
