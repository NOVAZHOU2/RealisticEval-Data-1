Sure! Here is the Java version of the Python code signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class BinaryTree {

    /**
     * Determines if two values are siblings in a binary tree represented as an array.
     *
     * @param tree the binary tree level-order representation
     * @param val1 the first value to check for sibling relationship
     * @param val2 the second value to check for sibling relationship
     * @return true if val1 and val2 are siblings, false otherwise
     */
    public static boolean areSiblings(List<Integer> tree, int val1, int val2) {
        // Method implementation will go here
        return false; // Placeholder return statement
    }
}
```

In this Java code:
- The `BinaryTree` class contains a static method `areSiblings`.
- The method takes three parameters: a `List<Integer>` representing the binary tree in level-order, and two integers `val1` and `val2`.
- The method returns a boolean indicating whether `val1` and `val2` are siblings in the binary tree.
