Sure, here is the equivalent Java method signature along with the Javadoc comments:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Handles nested question structures (e.g., maps, lists, and enumerations),
 * decodes bytes to UTF-8 strings, and converts numbers to integers or floating-point numbers.
 * 
 * @param data The question object as a map.
 * @return The map after conversion.
 */
public Map<String, Object> handleNestedData(Map<String, Object> data) {
    // Implementation goes here.
}
```

In this Java version:
- `Dict` from Python is translated to `Map<String, Object>` in Java.
- The return type `Dict` is also translated to `Map<String, Object>`.
- The Python docstring is converted to a Javadoc comment block.
- The method name and argument names are preserved for consistency.

You can add the implementation inside the method body as needed.
