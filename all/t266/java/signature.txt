Sure! Below is the equivalent Java method signature with the provided Python docstring translated into Java Javadoc format:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Handles nested data structures (e.g., dictionaries, lists, and enumerations),
 * decodes bytes to UTF-8 strings, and converts numbers to integers or floating-point numbers.
 *
 * @param data the question object
 * @return the converted question
 */
public Map<String, Object> handleNestedData(Map<String, Object> data) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `Map` interface from the `java.util` package is imported since it's used in the method signature.
2. **Javadoc Comments**: 
   - The `/** ... */` block is used for Javadoc comments in Java.
   - The description of the method is provided at the beginning of the comment.
   - The `@param` tag describes the input parameter `data`.
   - The `@return` tag describes the return value of the method.

This ensures that the method signature and documentation are clear and consistent with Java standards.
