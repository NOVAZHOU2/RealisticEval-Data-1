Here's how you can convert your Python function to JavaScript with similar functionality:

```javascript
/**
 * Verifies if the provided string is a valid email address.
 *
 * @param {string} email - The email address to validate.
 * @return {boolean} True if the email address is valid, False otherwise.
 */
function isValidEmail(email) {
```

This JavaScript function `isValidEmail` has the same purpose and parameters as your original Python function `is_valid_email`. It uses JSDoc-style comments for documentation, which is commonly used in JavaScript development environments. Note that JavaScript doesn't have type hints like Python does, so we just use `{string}` to indicate that the parameter should be a string.
