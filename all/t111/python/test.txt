To convert the provided JavaScript Jest test cases into Python's unittest framework, we need to create a test class that mirrors the structure and behavior of the original tests. In this conversion, we will use Python's built-in capabilities, including mocking where necessary.
Here's how the test cases would look in Python using the unittest library:
python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from datetime import datetime
from your_module import convert_chat_to_markdown  # Replace with your actual module name

class TestConvertChatToMarkdown(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_default_title(self):
        chat = ["Hello", "Hi there!"]
        blob = convert_chat_to_markdown(chat)
        expected_start = "# ChatGPT Conversation\n\n**Human:**\nHello\n\n***\n\n**Assistant:**\nHi there!\n\n***\n\nExported on "
        text = blob.text()  # Assuming blob has a text method that returns the string
        self.assertTrue(text.startswith(expected_start))

    def test_custom_title(self):
        chat = ["How are you?", "I'm doing well, thank you!"]
        title = "Friendly Chat"
        blob = convert_chat_to_markdown(chat, title)
        expected_start = "# Friendly Chat\n\n**Human:**\nHow are you?\n\n***\n\n**Assistant:**\nI'm doing well, thank you!\n\n***\n\nExported on "
        text = blob.text()  # Assuming blob has a text method that returns the string
        self.assertTrue(text.startswith(expected_start))

    def test_alternate_speakers(self):
        chat = ["Question?", "Answer.", "Another question?", "Another answer."]
        blob = convert_chat_to_markdown(chat)
        expected_content = "**Human:**\nQuestion?\n\n***\n\n**Assistant:**\nAnswer.\n\n***\n\n**Human:**\nAnother question?\n\n***\n\n**Assistant:**\nAnother answer.\n\n***\n\nExported on "
        text = blob.text()  # Assuming blob has a text method that returns the string
        self.assertIn(expected_content, text)

    @patch('your_module.datetime')
    def test_correct_timestamp(self, mock_datetime):
        chat = ["What's the time?", "It's now."]
        mock_datetime.now.return_value = datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
        blob = convert_chat_to_markdown(chat)
        expected_end = "Exported on 2024-01-01 12:00:00."
        text = blob.text()  # Assuming blob has a text method that returns the string
        self.assertTrue(text.endswith(expected_end))

    def test_blob_type(self):
        chat = ["This is a test.js.", "Yes, it is."]
        blob = convert_chat_to_markdown(chat)
        self.assertEqual(blob.type, 'text/markdown')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Code:
Imports:
unittest: The built-in Python library for writing unit tests.
unittest.mock: Used to create mock objects for testing (specifically for mocking the datetime).
datetime: To create the specific date for testing.
Test Class:
We create a class TestConvertChatToMarkdown that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Test Methods:
Each method corresponds to a Jest test case. The self.assertTrue() and self.assertEqual() methods are used to check conditions, similar to expect(...).toBe(...) in Jest.
text() method of the blob is assumed to return the text representation of the markdown, similar to the original JavaScript function.
For mocking the date, @patch decorator is used to mock datetime.now() to return a specific date and time.
Running the Tests:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the tests will run when the script is executed directly.
Note:
Make sure to replace your_module with the actual name of the module where your convert_chat_to_markdown function is defined.
The blob object in Python should have methods like text() and attributes like type similar to how they are used in JavaScript. If this isn't the case, you might need to adapt the test cases accordingly.
