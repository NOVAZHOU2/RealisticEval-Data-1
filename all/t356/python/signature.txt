Here’s the equivalent Python code signature with comments converted from C++ style to Python style, while preserving the original comments:
python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.

    :param arr: A list of integers to be sorted.
    """
    pass  # The function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The C++ function bubbleSort is renamed to bubble_sort to follow Python’s naming conventions (snake_case).
Comments Conversion:
The C++ comment style (/** ... */) is converted to a Python docstring using triple quotes. The brief description and parameter description are retained.
Parameter:
The C++ parameter type std::vector<int>& is changed to a simple list in Python, reflecting that lists are mutable and can be passed directly.
Function Body:
The function body includes a pass statement, indicating that the implementation will go here. This placeholder can be replaced with the actual Bubble Sort logic.
You can replace the pass statement with the actual Bubble Sort algorithm when you're ready to implement it.
