Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted into its equivalent TypeScript version, along with the comments adapted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param arr An array of integers to be sorted.
 */
function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Signature**: The C++ function `void bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& arr)` is translated to `function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): void`. The reference to the vector in C++ is simply represented as an array in TypeScript, which is inherently passed by reference.
- **Comment Style**: C++ comments are maintained, but the inline comment is adapted to be more relevant in TypeScript context.
