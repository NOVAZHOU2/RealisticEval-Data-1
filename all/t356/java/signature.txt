Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java version of the provided C++ function signature, maintaining the original functionality and structure:

```java
/**
 * @brief Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param arr A list of integers to be sorted.
 */
public static void bubbleSort(List<Integer> arr) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The C++ reference to a vector is replaced with `List<Integer>`.
- The method is declared as `public static` to align with Java conventions.
- C++ comments are converted to Javadoc format.
