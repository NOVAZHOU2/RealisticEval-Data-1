Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted to Python, with comments adjusted to Python style while preserving the original content:
Python Code Signature
python
def split_string(s: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Split a string into multiple substrings based on spaces and return a list containing these substrings.

    :param s: The input string to be split into words.
    :return: A list of strings, each representing a word from the input string. Returns an empty list if the input string is empty or contains only spaces.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
The function name is changed from splitString (C++) to split_string (Python) to adhere to Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type:
The parameter str is renamed to s in Python to avoid shadowing the built-in str type.
Return Type:
The return type is specified as list[str], indicating the function will return a list of strings.
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted into a Python docstring using triple quotes. The content is preserved, clearly describing the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
Function Body:
The function body is marked with pass, indicating where the implementation would be added.
This format provides a clear and idiomatic Python function signature with documentation, ready for implementation.
