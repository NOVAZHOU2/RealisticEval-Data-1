Here’s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function that splits a string into words:
Python Code
python
def split_string(s: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Split the input string into a list of words.

    :param s: The string to be split.
    :return: A list of words obtained from the input string.
    """
    result = []
    words = s.split()  # Split the string by whitespace
    for word in words:
        result.append(word)  # Add each word to the result list
    return result
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition:
The function name is changed from splitString (C++) to split_string (Python) to follow Python's naming conventions.
Parameter Type:
The parameter str is renamed to s in Python to avoid shadowing the built-in str type. The type hint str is also added for clarity.
List Initialization:
An empty list result is initialized to store the words.
String Splitting:
The built-in split() method of strings is used to split the string into words based on whitespace. This is more Pythonic than using an istringstream as in C++.
Appending Words:
Each word from the split operation is appended to the result list.
Docstring:
A docstring is added to describe the function and its parameters, similar to the comments in C++.
Usage Example
Here’s how you might use this function:
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_string = "Hello world, this is a test."
    words = split_string(input_string)
    print(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'world,', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test.']
This example demonstrates splitting a string into words and printing the result.
