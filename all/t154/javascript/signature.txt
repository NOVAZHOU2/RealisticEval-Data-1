Hereâ€™s the JavaScript version of the TypeScript function signature, keeping the comments intact:

```javascript
// Define the types for the objects we're working with
// Note: JavaScript does not have interfaces, so we will use plain objects.

/**
 * Parsing a string containing the contents of a Git diff returns an array of objects with details of each file's changes
 *
 * @param {string} diffText - The Git diff text to parse.
 * @returns {Array} - An array of objects representing the diff for each file.
 */
// @ts-ignore
function parseGitDiff(diffText) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. Removed TypeScript-specific type annotations.
2. Adjusted the return type in the comments to reflect JavaScript's dynamic typing (`Array` instead of `GitDiffFile[]`).
