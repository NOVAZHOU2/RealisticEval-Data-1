To convert the given TypeScript code signature into Python while keeping the code comments, we'll use Python's typing features. Here's how you can rewrite the TypeScript code signature in Python:
python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

# Define the types for the objects we're working with
class GitDiffChange:
    def __init__(self, diff: Optional[str] = None, code: Optional[str] = None):
        self.diff = diff  # Optional diff string
        self.code = code  # Optional code string

class GitDiffFile:
    def __init__(self, old_path: str, new_path: str, changes: List[GitDiffChange], 
                 new_file_mode: Optional[str] = None, 
                 deleted_file_mode: Optional[str] = None, 
                 index: Optional[str] = None):
        self.old_path = old_path  # Old file path
        self.new_path = new_path  # New file path
        self.changes = changes  # List of GitDiffChange objects
        self.new_file_mode = new_file_mode  # New file mode or None
        self.deleted_file_mode = deleted_file_mode  # Deleted file mode or None
        self.index = index  # Index or None

def parse_git_diff(diff_text: str) -> List[GitDiffFile]:
    """
    Parsing a string containing the contents of a Git diff returns an array of objects with details of each file's changes

    :param diff_text: The Git diff text to parse.
    :return: An array of objects representing the diff for each file.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Type Definitions:
The interfaces in TypeScript are converted to classes in Python.
Optional from typing is used to indicate that a parameter can be None.
Constructor:
Python uses __init__ for constructors, initializing instance variables.
Function Signature:
The parse_git_diff function in Python has a type hint for its parameter and return type.
Comments:
The comments from the TypeScript code are retained in the Python code to maintain clarity and documentation.
This structure preserves the semantics of the TypeScript code while conforming to Python's syntax and style.
