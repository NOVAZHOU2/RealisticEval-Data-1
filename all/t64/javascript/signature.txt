Here is the equivalent JavaScript code signature for your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Converts the contents of a csv file into an SQL insert statement with a table name with the suffix removed.
 *
 * @param {string} csvFilePath - csv file path
 * @returns {string} parsed sql string
 */
function csvToSqlInsert(csvFilePath) {
```

This JavaScript version maintains the same structure and documentation style as your original Python code, including the JSDoc comment format which is commonly used in JavaScript projects to document functions and their parameters.
