Here is your Python function translated into TypeScript:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

/**
 * Converts the contents of a csv file into an SQL insert statement with a table name with the suffix removed.
 *
 * @param {string} csvFilePath - csv file path
 * @returns {string} - parsed sql string
 */
function csvToSqlInsert(csvFilePath: string): string {
```

Note that in TypeScript we don't have type hints for built-in functions like Python's `os` and `csv`, so I've replaced them with their equivalent Node.js modules (`fs` and `path`). Also, the return type of the function is specified as `string`.
