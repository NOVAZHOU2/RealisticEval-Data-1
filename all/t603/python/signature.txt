Here's the converted C++ code signature into a Python code signature. The comments have been adapted to Python style while retaining their original meaning.
python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """ 
    Check if a given year is a leap year.

    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Signature: The C++ function bool isLeapYear(int year) is converted to Python syntax as def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:.
The function name has been changed to is_leap_year to follow Python's naming convention of using snake_case.
Docstring: The C++ comment block is converted into a Python docstring (triple quotes).
The @brief, @param, and @return annotations from C++ are replaced with "Check if a given year is a leap year", "Args", and "Returns" respectively, making it more idiomatic to Python.
Function Body: A placeholder pass statement is included to indicate that the function will be implemented later. This maintains the structure of the code while making it syntactically correct in Python.
This format follows Python conventions for function definitions and documentation, making it clear and easy to understand for Python developers.
