Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided C++ function that checks if a given year is a leap year:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Checks if a given year is a leap year.
 *
 * @param {number} year - The year to check.
 * @return {boolean} True if the year is a leap year, false otherwise.
 */
function isLeapYear(year) {
    // A year is a leap year if:
    // 1. It is divisible by 4 AND
    // 2. It is NOT divisible by 100, OR it is divisible by 400
    return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0);
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Function Declaration**: Changed from `bool isLeapYear(int year)` to `function isLeapYear(year)`.
2. **Parameter Type Annotation**: Added JSDoc-style comments for parameter and return type.
3. **Equality Operators**: Used `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=` for strict equality checks, which is a best practice in JavaScript.
