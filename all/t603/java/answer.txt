Here's the equivalent Java code based on the provided C++ code. The functionality, logic, and structure have been preserved while adapting to Java's syntax and conventions.

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * @brief Checks if a given year is a leap year.
 *
 * @param year The year to check.
 * @return True if the year is a leap year, false otherwise.
 */
public class Answer {
    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        // A year is a leap year if:
        // 1. It is divisible by 4 AND
        // 2. It is NOT divisible by 100, OR it is divisible by 400
        return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
    }
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Package Declaration**: Added the package declaration at the top.
2. **Class Declaration**: Created a class named `Answer`.
3. **Method Signature**: Changed the method to be static and public, aligning with Java's object-oriented principles.
4. **Type Declaration**: Kept the same return type for the method.
