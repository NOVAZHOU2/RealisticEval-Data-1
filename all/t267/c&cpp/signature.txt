Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <tuple>

/**
 * Extracts the second-level and top-level domain names from the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
 *
 * @param fqdn The fully qualified domain name.
 * @return A tuple containing the second-level domain and top-level domain.
 */
std::tuple<std::string, std::string> extract_sld_tld(const std::string& fqdn);
```

This C++ code includes the necessary headers for string manipulation and tuple handling, and it provides a documentation comment that matches the Python version you provided.
