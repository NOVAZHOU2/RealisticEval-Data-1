Certainly! Below is an equivalent C++ test case using Catch2 for the `extract_sld_tld` function. Note that I'll assume you have the implementation of `extract_sld_tld` in C++.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed and set up in your project. If not, you can install it via vcpkg or add it manually.

Here's the C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include "extract_sld_tld.h" // Include the header file where extract_sld_tld is defined

// Assuming extract_sld_tld is defined in extract_sld_tld.cpp
std::pair<std::string, std::string> extract_sld_tld(const std::string& fqdn);

TEST_CASE("Extract SLD and TLD", "[extract_sld_tld]") {
    SECTION("Basic Test Case") {
        auto [sld, tld] = extract_sld_tld("example.com");
        REQUIRE(sld == "example");
        REQUIRE(tld == "com");
    }

    SECTION("Subdomain Test Case") {
        auto [sld, tld] = extract_sld_tld("sub.example.co.uk");
        REQUIRE(sld == "sub.example");
        REQUIRE(tld == "co.uk");
    }

    SECTION("Multiple Subdomains Test Case") {
        auto [sld, tld] = extract_sld_tld("level1.level2.sub.example.net");
        REQUIRE(sld == "level1.level2.sub.example");
        REQUIRE(tld == "net");
    }

    SECTION("Top-Level Domain with Hyphen") {
        auto [sld, tld] = extract_sld_tld("example-domain.com");
        REQUIRE(sld == "example-domain");
        REQUIRE(tld == "com");
    }

    SECTION("Single Label Domain") {
        auto [sld, tld] = extract_sld_tld("example");
        REQUIRE(sld.empty());
        REQUIRE(tld == "example");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` directive includes the Catch2 testing framework.
2. **Function Declaration**: The `extract_sld_tld` function is assumed to be declared in a header file named `extract_sld_tld.h`.
3. **Test Case Definition**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a test case named "Extract SLD and TLD".
4. **Sections**: Each `SECTION` within `TEST_CASE` represents a specific scenario to test the function.
5. **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to assert that the output of `extract_sld_tld` matches the expected results.

Make sure your `extract_sld_tld` function is implemented correctly in `extract_sld_tld.cpp` and that the necessary headers are included. This should give you a good starting point for writing your C++ tests using Catch2.
