Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function, including the appropriate documentation using JSDoc style comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts the second-level domain (SLD) and top-level domain (TLD) from the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
 * 
 * @param fqdn - The fully qualified domain name.
 * @returns A tuple containing the second-level domain and the top-level domain.
 */
function extractSldTld(fqdn: string): [string, string] {
    // Implementation would go here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The function `extract_sld_tld` is renamed to `extractSldTld` to follow camelCase naming convention, which is more common in TypeScript.
- The return type annotation `[string, string]` represents a tuple with two strings.
- The JSDoc-style comments are used to document the function, its parameters, and its return value.
