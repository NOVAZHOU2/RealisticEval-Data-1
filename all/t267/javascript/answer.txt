Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python function:

```javascript
function extractSldTld(fqdn) {
    /**
     * Extracts the second-level domain (SLD) and top-level domain (TLD) from a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
     *
     * @param {string} fqdn - The fully qualified domain name.
     * @returns {Array} An array containing the second-level domain and top-level domain.
     */
    // Split the FQDN into parts
    const parts = fqdn.split('.');

    // Check if there are enough parts to extract SLD and TLD
    if (parts.length < 2) {
        throw new Error("The provided FQDN does not contain enough parts to extract SLD and TLD.");
    }

    // Extract the SLD and TLD
    const sld = parts[parts.length - 2];  // Second to last item is the SLD
    const tld = parts[parts.length - 1];  // Last item is the TLD

    return [sld, tld];
}
```

This JavaScript function maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the original Python code. It extracts the second-level domain (SLD) and top-level domain (TLD) from a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
