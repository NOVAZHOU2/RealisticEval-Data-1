Sure! Here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the second-level and top-level domain names from the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
 * @param {string} fqdn - The fully qualified domain name.
 * @returns {Array} An array containing the second-level domain and top-level domain.
 */
function extractSLDAndTLD(fqdn) {
    // Implementation would go here
}
```

Note that the implementation details are not included as they depend on the specific logic used in the Python function. The function `extract_sld_tld` has been renamed to `extractSLDAndTLD` to follow common JavaScript naming conventions. The return type is specified as `Array`, which is a common way to represent tuples in JavaScript since JavaScript does not have a native tuple type.
