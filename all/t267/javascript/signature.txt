Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code with the same function signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the second-level and top-level domain names from the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
 *
 * @param {string} fqdn - The fully qualified domain name.
 * @returns {Array<string>} An array containing the second-level domain and top-level domain.
 */
function extractSldTld(fqdn) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature matches the Python one you provided, including the docstring for clarity and parameter descriptions.
