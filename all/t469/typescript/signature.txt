Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python code with the same function signature and comments:

```typescript
type Matrix = number[][];
type ScaleFactors = [number, number];

/**
 * Given a 3x3 affine transformation matrix, return the corresponding scaling factors
 * along the x and y axes.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 3x3 affine transformation matrix.
 * @returns A tuple containing the scale factors (scaleX, scaleY).
 */
function getScale(matrix: Matrix): ScaleFactors {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In this TypeScript code:
- `Matrix` is defined as a type alias for a 2D array of numbers.
- `ScaleFactors` is defined as a type alias for a tuple of two numbers.
- The function `getScale` has the same parameters and return type as your original Python function.
