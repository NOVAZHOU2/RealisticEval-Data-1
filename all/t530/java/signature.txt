Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided JavaScript function, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Creates a matrix with the specified number of rows and columns,
 * filled with the given initial value.
 *
 * @param rows The number of rows in the matrix.
 * @param columns The number of columns in the matrix.
 * @param initialValue The value to fill the matrix with.
 *                   It can be of any type (int, String, Object, etc.).
 * @return A two-dimensional array (matrix) filled with the initial value.
 */
public static Object[][] createMatrix(int rows, int columns, Object initialValue) {
}
```

In Java, we use `Object` as the generic type to handle different types of values that might be used as the initial value. If you need more specific type safety, you could parameterize the method further or use other design patterns like generics.
