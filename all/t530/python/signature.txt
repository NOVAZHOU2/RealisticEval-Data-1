Sure, here is the Python code signature with the same functionality and comments:

```python
"""
Creates a matrix with the specified number of rows and columns,
filled with the given initial value.

:param rows: The number of rows in the matrix.
:type rows: int

:param columns: The number of columns in the matrix.
:type columns: int

:param initialValue: The value to fill the matrix with.
                   It can be of any type (int, str, dict, etc.).
:type initialValue: Any

:return: A two-dimensional list (matrix) filled with the initial value.
:rtype: List[List[Any]]
"""
def create_matrix(rows, columns, initial_value):
```

This Python function `create_matrix` has the same parameters and return type as the JavaScript function `createMatrix`, and it includes docstring comments that describe the purpose and usage of the function.
