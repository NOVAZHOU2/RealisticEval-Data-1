To convert the JavaScript code signature you provided into a Python code signature, we can use Python's type hinting to represent the parameters and return type. Hereâ€™s how you can rewrite the JavaScript function signature in Python:
python
def create_matrix(rows: int, columns: int, initial_value: any) -> list:
    """Creates a matrix with the specified number of rows and columns,
    filled with the given initial value.

    Args:
        rows (int): The number of rows in the matrix.
        columns (int): The number of columns in the matrix.
        initial_value (any): The value to fill the matrix with.
                             It can be of any type (number, string, object, etc.).

    Returns:
        list: A two-dimensional list (matrix) filled with the initial value.
    """
    pass  # Replace with implementation
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition: Changed function createMatrix to def create_matrix.
Parameter Types: Added type hints for rows and columns as int, and initial_value as any, which allows for any type (similar to JavaScript).
Return Type: Specified that the return type is list, which corresponds to a two-dimensional array in Python.
Docstring Format: Converted the JSDoc style comments into a Python docstring format using triple quotes.
Additional Note:
In Python, the type any is not directly available, but you can import Any from the typing module if you want to be more explicit:
python
from typing import Any
def create_matrix(rows: int, columns: int, initial_value: Any) -> list:
The pass statement is a placeholder indicating that the function implementation should be added later.
