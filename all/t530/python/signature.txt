Sure! Here is the Python code signature with the same comments:

```python
def create_matrix(rows: int, columns: int, initial_value):
    """
    Creates a matrix with the specified number of rows and columns,
    filled with the given initial value.

    :param rows: The number of rows in the matrix.
    :type rows: int
    :param columns: The number of columns in the matrix.
    :type columns: int
    :param initial_value: The value to fill the matrix with.
                         It can be of any type (int, str, dict, etc.).
    :return: A two-dimensional list (matrix) filled with the initial value.
    :rtype: list
    """
```

This function definition uses Python's type hints for better clarity and documentation.
