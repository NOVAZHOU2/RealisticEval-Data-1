Sure! Below is the Python equivalent of the provided JavaScript function, which creates a matrix with specified rows and columns, filling it with an initial value.
JavaScript Code
javascript
function createMatrix(rows, columns, initialValue) {
    // Initialize the matrix as an empty array
    const matrix = [];
    // Loop through each row
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        // Create a new row array
        const row = [];
        // Loop through each column and fill the row with the initial value
        for (let j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
            row.push(initialValue);
        }
        // Add the filled row to the matrix
        matrix.push(row);
    }
    return matrix;
}
Python Code
python
def create_matrix(rows, columns, initial_value):
    # Initialize the matrix as an empty list
    matrix = []
    # Loop through each row
    for i in range(rows):
        # Create a new row list filled with the initial value
        row = [initial_value] * columns
        # Add the filled row to the matrix
        matrix.append(row)
    return matrix
Explanation
In the JavaScript code, an empty array (const matrix = [];) is initialized to hold the rows of the matrix. In Python, this is done with an empty list (matrix = []).
A loop iterates through the number of rows (for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) in JavaScript and for i in range(rows) in Python).
For each row, a new row is created and filled with the initialValue using a nested loop in JavaScript and a list comprehension in Python (row = [initial_value] * columns).
Finally, the filled row is appended to the matrix.
Usage
You can use the function in Python like this:
python
matrix = create_matrix(3, 4, 0)  # Creates a 3x4 matrix filled with 0
print(matrix)
This would output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
