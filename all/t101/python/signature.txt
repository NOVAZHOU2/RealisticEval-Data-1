To convert the provided JavaScript code signature into a Python code signature, you'll want to use a function definition with type hints and a docstring that describes the parameters and their expected types. Below is the equivalent Python code signature:
Python Code Signature
python
def is_break_time(start_time: str, end_time: str, current_time: str) -> None:
    """
    Determine whether the current time is within the specified time range (i.e., whether it is a break).

    Args:
        start_time (str): The start time of the break in HH:MM format.
        end_time (str): The end time of the break in HH:MM format.
        current_time (str): The current time in HH:MM format.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation
Function Definition:
The function is named is_break_time, following Python's naming convention of using snake_case.
It accepts three parameters: start_time, end_time, and current_time, all of which are annotated as str to indicate that they are expected to be strings.
Return Type:
The return type is specified as None, which is appropriate since the original function in JavaScript does not return a value (as indicated by the empty braces).
Docstring:
A docstring is included that describes the purpose of the function and details the parameters, similar to the JavaScript documentation comments. It uses the Args section to explain each parameter.
Pass Statement:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder to indicate that the implementation will go here later.
This structure is typical for defining functions in Python, providing clear documentation and adhering to type hinting standards.
