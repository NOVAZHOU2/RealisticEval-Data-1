Hereâ€™s how to convert the provided JavaScript function into Python code. The structure and logic remain the same, but Python's syntax is used, including proper handling of data types and the lack of curly braces.
Converted Python Code
python
def is_break_time(start_time: str, end_time: str, current_time: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if the current time falls within the break time range.

    Args:
        start_time (str): The start time of the break in HH:MM format.
        end_time (str): The end time of the break in HH:MM format.
        current_time (str): The current time in HH:MM format.

    Returns:
        bool: Returns True if the current time is within the break time range, False otherwise.
    """
    # Split the time strings into hours and minutes
    start_hour, start_minute = map(int, start_time.split(':'))
    end_hour, end_minute = map(int, end_time.split(':'))
    current_hour, current_minute = map(int, current_time.split(':'))

    # Calculate total minutes since midnight
    start_total_minutes = start_hour * 60 + start_minute
    end_total_minutes = end_hour * 60 + end_minute
    current_total_minutes = current_hour * 60 + current_minute

    # Check if the current time falls within the break time range
    return start_total_minutes <= current_total_minutes <= end_total_minutes
Explanation of the Python Code
Function Definition:
The function is named is_break_time, using snake_case as per Python conventions.
It takes three parameters: start_time, end_time, and current_time, all of which are strings in the HH:MM format.
Docstring:
A docstring explains the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return type, formatted in a way that Python developers expect.
Time Parsing:
The map(int, start_time.split(':')) is used to convert the split string values of hours and minutes directly to integers, similar to the JavaScript map(Number).
Total Minutes Calculation:
The total minutes since midnight for the start time, end time, and current time are calculated using the same logic as in the JavaScript code.
Return Statement:
The final return statement checks if current_total_minutes is within the range defined by start_total_minutes and end_total_minutes.
Usage Example
You can use the function like this:
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_time = "12:00"
    end_time = "14:00"
    current_time = "13:30"
    
    if is_break_time(start_time, end_time, current_time):
        print("It is break time.")
    else:
        print("It is not break time.")
This example checks if the current time ("13:30") falls within the break time range defined by the start time ("12:00") and end time ("14:00").
