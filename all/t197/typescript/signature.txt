Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided C++ function signature and comments, along with the appropriate adaptations for TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Simulate a game based on the order of prime numbers, using a circular linked list
 * to represent the cyclic structure of players, and remove players one by one.
 *
 * This function creates an instance of the PrimeGame class, which encapsulates the logic
 * for simulating the game. It then calls the findOrder method on the PrimeGame object
 * to determine and return the order in which players are removed based on the sequence of prime numbers.
 *
 * @param n The number of players in the game.
 * @return An array of numbers representing the order of players being removed from the ring.
 */
function findOrder(n: number): number[] {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: The return type is specified as `number[]` instead of `vector<int>`, as TypeScript uses arrays.

2. **Parameter Type**: The parameter `n` is annotated as `number` to denote its type in TypeScript.

3. **Comment Style**: C++ comments are converted to TypeScript-style comments, preserving the content and structure.

4. **No Memory Management**: TypeScript handles memory management automatically, so there's no need for manual memory management like in C++. 

This conversion maintains the original functionality while adhering to TypeScript conventions.
