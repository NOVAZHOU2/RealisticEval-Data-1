Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided C++ function signature and comments into an equivalent Java version, using the appropriate conventions and formatting:

```java
/**
 * Simulates a game based on the order of prime numbers, using a circular linked list to represent 
 * the cyclic structure of players, and removes players one by one.
 *
 * This method creates an instance of the PrimeGame class, which encapsulates the logic
 * for simulating the game. It then calls the findOrder method on the PrimeGame object
 * to determine and return the order in which players are removed based on the sequence of prime numbers.
 *
 * @param n The number of players in the game.
 * @return A List of integers representing the order of players being removed from the ring.
 */
import java.util.List;

public List<Integer> findOrder(int n) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: Changed `vector<int>` to `List<Integer>` to match Java's type system.
2. **Comments**: Converted the C++ comments to Javadoc format using `/** ... */`.
3. **Import Statement**: Included an import statement for `List` from the `java.util` package, which is common in Java for handling lists.
