/**
 * Simulates a game based on the order of prime numbers, using a circular linked list to represent 
 * the cyclic structure of players, and removes players one by one.
 *
 * This method creates an instance of the PrimeGame class, which encapsulates the logic
 * for simulating the game. It then calls the findOrder method on the PrimeGame object
 * to determine and return the order in which players are removed based on the sequence of prime numbers.
 *
 * @param n The number of players in the game.
 * @return A List of integers representing the order of players being removed from the ring.
