Here's the C++ function signature and comments converted into their equivalent JavaScript version, preserving the original functionality and structure:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Simulate a game based on the order of prime numbers, using a circular linked list to represent the cyclic structure of players, and remove players one by one.
 *
 * This function creates an instance of the PrimeGame class, which encapsulates the logic
 * for simulating the game. It then calls the findOrder method on the PrimeGame object
 * to determine and return the order in which players are removed based on the sequence of prime numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} n - The number of players in the game.
 * @return {Array<number>} - An array of integers representing the order of players being removed from the ring.
 */
function findOrder(n) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature:** Converted `vector<int> findOrder(int n)` to `function findOrder(n)`.
2. **Parameter Type:** Specified the parameter type as `{number}` in the comment for clarity.
3. **Return Type:** Changed `A vector of integers` to `{Array<number>}` in the comment for the return type.
4. **JavaScript-style Comments:** Retained the original comment format, which is compatible with JavaScript. 

You can implement the function body as needed, following the structure and logic you've developed in the JavaScript implementation.
