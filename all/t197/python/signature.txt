Certainly! Below is the converted code signature from C++ to Python, including the comments converted to Python-style comments.

Key Changes
The C++ return type vector<int> was changed to Python's list.
The C++ comments were converted to Python docstring format using triple quotes.
The function name was changed from findOrder to find_order to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
The function body is marked with pass to indicate that the implementation is yet to be written.
You can implement the logic of the find_order function as needed in your Python code.
