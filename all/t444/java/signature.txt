Sure! Below is the equivalent Java method signature for your Python function, keeping the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Formats a string into a commented block with specified maximum line length.
 *
 * @param string     the input string to format
 * @param maxLength  the maximum length of each line in the output
 * @return           a formatted string with each line prefixed by '# ' and not exceeding the specified maxLength
 */
public String formatComment(String string, int maxLength) {
```

This Java method signature includes the necessary Javadoc comments that describe the purpose of the method, its parameters, and its return value, just like the Python docstring you provided.
