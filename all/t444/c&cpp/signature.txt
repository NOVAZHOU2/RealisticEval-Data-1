Here's the equivalent C++ function along with the translated comments:

```cpp
#include <string>

// Formats a string into a commented block with a specified maximum line length.
// 
// @param string The input string to format.
// @param max_length Maximum length of each line in the output.
// @return A formatted string with each line prefixed by '// ' and not exceeding the specified max_length.
std::string format_comment(const std::string& string, int max_length = 60) {
    // Implementation goes here.
}
```

The comments have been adapted to use `//` for single-line comments. Multi-line comments can be added similarly using `/* ... */` if needed. Note that the implementation details are left out as they were not provided in the original Python function.
