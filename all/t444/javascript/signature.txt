Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Formats a string into a commented block with a specified maximum line length.
 * Each line in the output will be prefixed by '# ' and will not exceed the specified max_length.
 *
 * @param {string} string - The input string to format.
 * @param {number} [max_length=60] - Maximum length of each line in the output.
 * @returns {string} A formatted string with each line prefixed by '# ' and not exceeding the specified max_length.
 */
function formatComment(string, max_length = 60) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

Note: The actual implementation logic for `formatComment` would need to be provided inside the function body based on the intended functionality described in the comments.
