Certainly! Below is the equivalent Jest test class in TypeScript for the provided Python unittest class. The test cases are converted to use Jest assertions, and the necessary type annotations are included.

### TypeScript Code

```typescript
import { formatComment } from './path/to/formatComment'; // Import the formatComment function

describe('TestFormatComment', () => {
    it('test with a short string that fits within max_length', () => {
        const inputString = "This is a test.";
        const expectedOutput = "# This is a test.";
        expect(formatComment(inputString)).toBe(expectedOutput);
    });

    it('test with a longer string that exceeds max_length', () => {
        const inputString = "This is a test of the format_comment function which should wrap long lines correctly.";
        const expectedOutput = 
            "# This is a test of the format_comment function which should\n" +
            "# wrap long lines correctly.";
        expect(formatComment(inputString, 60)).toBe(expectedOutput);
    });

    it('test with multiple lines of input', () => {
        const inputString = "First line.\nSecond line that is quite long and needs to be wrapped.";
        const expectedOutput = 
            "# First line.\n" +
            "# Second line that is quite long and needs to be wrapped.";
        expect(formatComment(inputString, 60)).toBe(expectedOutput);
    });

    it('test with a line that is exactly max_length characters long', () => {
        const inputString = "A".repeat(60); // 60 characters long
        const expectedOutput = "# " + "A".repeat(60);
        expect(formatComment(inputString, 60)).toBe(expectedOutput);
    });

    it('test with an empty string', () => {
        const inputString = "";
        const expectedOutput = "# ";
        expect(formatComment(inputString)).toBe(expectedOutput);
    });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Statement**: The `formatComment` function is imported from the appropriate module.
2. **Describe Block**: The `describe` block is used to group the test cases under a descriptive name.
3. **It Blocks**: Each test case is defined using the `it` block, which includes a description and the actual test logic.
4. **Assertions**: The `expect` function is used with the `toBe` matcher to compare the actual output with the expected output.

### Additional Notes:
- **Type Annotations**: Since the `formatComment` function already has type annotations, there is no need to add additional type annotations in the test cases.
- **String Repeating**: The `repeat` method is used to create a string of repeated characters, similar to the Python `*` operator for strings.

Make sure to adjust the import statement (`import { formatComment } from './path/to/formatComment';`) to match the actual path where your `formatComment` function is defined. This will ensure that the tests can access the function correctly.
