Certainly! Below is the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function, including appropriate JSDoc-style documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Formats a string into a commented block with a specified maximum line length.
 * 
 * @param string - The input string to format.
 * @param maxLength - The maximum length of each line in the output. Defaults to 60.
 * @returns A formatted string with each line prefixed by '# ' and not exceeding the specified maxLength.
 */
function formatComment(string: string, maxLength: number = 60): string {
    // Split the string into lines
    const lines = string.split('\n');

    // Initialize an array to store the formatted lines
    let formattedLines: string[] = [];

    // Iterate through the lines
    for (let line of lines) {
        // Split the line into words
        const words = line.split(' ');

        // Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line
        let currentLine = '';

        // Iterate through the words
        for (let word of words) {
            // If the current line plus the next word would be too long,
            // append the current line to the list of formatted lines and start a new line
            if (currentLine.length + word.length + (currentLine ? 1 : 0) > maxLength) {
                formattedLines.push(currentLine);
                currentLine = '';
            }

            // If the current line is empty, add the word to the line
            // Otherwise, add a space and the word to the line
            if (currentLine === '') {
                currentLine = word;
            } else {
                currentLine += ' ' + word;
            }
        }

        // Add the remaining line to the list of formatted lines
        formattedLines.push(currentLine);
    }

    // Return the formatted comment
    return formattedLines.map(line => '# ' + line).join('\n');
}

// Example usage
const exampleString = "This is a very long string that needs to be split into multiple lines to ensure it does not exceed the maximum length.";
console.log(formatComment(exampleString, 20));
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Documentation**: The function is documented using JSDoc-style comments, which include descriptions of the parameters and return type.
2. **Function Signature**: The function `formatComment` is defined with type annotations for the parameters and return type.
3. **Splitting Lines**: The input string is split into lines using the newline character `\n`.
4. **Formatted Lines Array**: An array `formattedLines` is initialized to store the formatted lines.
5. **Iterating Through Lines**: Each line is processed by splitting it into words and then iterating through those words.
6. **Current Line Tracking**: The variable `currentLine` keeps track of the current line being built.
7. **Word Length Check**: If adding a word would exceed the `maxLength`, the current line is added to `formattedLines` and a new line is started.
8. **Appending Words**: Words are appended to the current line with appropriate spacing.
9. **Adding Remaining Line**: After processing all words in a line, the remaining line is added to `formattedLines`.
10. **Formatting and Joining**: The final formatted lines are prefixed with `# ` and joined together with newline characters.

This TypeScript code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code, with appropriate type annotations and documentation.
