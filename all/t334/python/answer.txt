Hereâ€™s how to translate the provided TypeScript function calculateGoodFriday into Python. The Python version uses the datetime module to handle date manipulations.
python
from datetime import date, timedelta

def calculate_good_friday(year: int) -> date:
    """ 
    Calculates the date of Good Friday for a given year using the anonymous Gregorian algorithm 
    to compute the date of Easter Sunday. Good Friday is two days before Easter Sunday.
    
    Args:
        year (int): The year for which to calculate Good Friday.
    
    Returns:
        date: The date of Good Friday.
    """
    # Anonymous Gregorian algorithm to compute the date of Easter Sunday
    a = year % 19
    b = year // 100
    c = year % 100
    d = b // 4
    e = b % 4
    f = (b + 8) // 25
    g = (b - f + 1) // 3
    h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) % 30
    i = c // 4
    k = c % 4
    l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) % 7
    m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) // 451
    month = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) // 31
    day = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) % 31 + 1

    # Easter Sunday date
    easter = date(year, month, day)

    # Good Friday is two days before Easter Sunday
    good_friday = easter - timedelta(days=2)

    return good_friday

# Example usage:
year = 2024
good_friday_date = calculate_good_friday(year)
print(f"Good Friday in {year} is on {good_friday_date}")
Explanation of the Python Code:
Imports:
The date and timedelta classes are imported from the datetime module to manage dates and perform date arithmetic.
Function Definition:
The function calculate_good_friday is defined to take a single parameter year, which is expected to be an integer.
Docstring:
A docstring is included to describe the function's purpose, the argument it takes, and what it returns.
Easter Calculation:
The algorithm for calculating the date of Easter Sunday is directly translated from TypeScript. Python's integer division operator // is used in place of Math.floor().
Good Friday Calculation:
The date for Good Friday is calculated by subtracting two days from the date of Easter using timedelta.
Return Value:
The function returns the calculated date of Good Friday.
Example Usage:
An example usage of the function is provided, which demonstrates how to call the function and print the result.
Output
When you run the example code with the specified year (e.g., 2024), it will print the date of Good Friday for that year:
Good Friday in 2024 is on 2024-03-29
You can adjust the year variable to test other years as needed.
