Hereâ€™s how to convert the TypeScript code signature to a Python code signature while keeping the comments intact:
python
def calculate_good_friday(year: int) -> date:
    """ 
    Calculate the date of Good Friday in a given year.
    
    For example:
        input: 2024
        output: Fri Mar 29 2024

    Args:
        year (int): The year for which to calculate Good Friday.
    
    Returns:
        date: The date of Good Friday.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
Explanation of the Python Code Signature:
Function Definition:
The function calculate_good_friday is defined to take a parameter year of type int.
Return Type:
The return type is specified as date, which indicates that the function will return a date object.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are converted into a Python docstring, explaining the function's purpose, providing an example of input and output, and detailing the parameter and return types.
Placeholder Implementation:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function body, indicating that the implementation will go here later.
Note:
Make sure to import the date class from the datetime module at the beginning of your script if you plan to implement the function:
python
from datetime import date
