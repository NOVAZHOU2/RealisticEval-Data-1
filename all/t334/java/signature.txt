Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the date of Good Friday in a given year.
 * For example:
 *      input: 2024
 *      output: Fri Mar 29 2024
 * @param year the year for which to calculate Good Friday
 * @return the date of Good Friday
 */
public static Date calculateGoodFriday(int year) {
    // Implementation here
}
``` 

This maintains the documentation style from TypeScript while adapting it to Java.
