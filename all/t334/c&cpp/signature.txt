Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate the date of Good Friday in a given year
 * For example:
 *      input: 2024
 *      output: Fri Mar 29 2024
 * @param year The year for which to calculate Good Friday
 * @return std::tm structure representing Good Friday
 */
std::tm calculateGoodFriday(int year);
```

### Explanation:
- The comment block retains the original description and format.
- The function signature specifies the return type as `std::tm`, indicating it will return a date structure.
