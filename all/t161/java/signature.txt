Here's the Java code signature with comments, translated from the provided TypeScript code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Produces all combinations of numeric arrays for each key in the given map object
 * and returns them as a two-dimensional array.
 *
 * @param map A map where each key is a string, and each value is a list of integers.
 * @return A list of lists, where each sub-list is a unique combination of numbers from the map's values.
 */
public List<List<Integer>> generateCombinations(Map<String, List<Integer>> map) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- Changed `number[]` to `List<Integer>` since Java uses lists instead of arrays.
- Updated the return type to `List<List<Integer>>`.
- Retained the method comments from the TypeScript version.
