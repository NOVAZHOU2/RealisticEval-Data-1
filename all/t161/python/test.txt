Here’s the equivalent Python code for your TypeScript Jest test cases, using Python's unittest framework. The logic is kept the same as in your TypeScript tests, but adapted to Python's style.
Python unittest Test Cases:
python
import unittest

# Assuming `generate_combinations` is already defined in the same module or imported
# from the module where it's implemented.
# from your_module import generate_combinations

class TestGenerateCombinations(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_single_key_multiple_values(self):
        # Test: generates combinations for a single key with multiple values
        map_data = {'a': [1, 2, 3]}
        expected = [[1], [2], [3]]
        self.assertEqual(generate_combinations(map_data), expected)
    
    def test_multiple_keys_single_values(self):
        # Test: generates combinations for multiple keys with single values
        map_data = {'a': [1], 'b': [2]}
        expected = [[1, 2]]
        self.assertEqual(generate_combinations(map_data), expected)
    
    def test_multiple_keys_multiple_values(self):
        # Test: generates combinations for multiple keys with multiple values
        map_data = {'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3, 4]}
        expected = [
            [1, 3], [1, 4],
            [2, 3], [2, 4]
        ]
        self.assertEqual(generate_combinations(map_data), expected)
    
    def test_empty_map(self):
        # Test: handles an empty map
        map_data = {}
        expected = [[]]
        self.assertEqual(generate_combinations(map_data), expected)
    
    def test_empty_array_values(self):
        # Test: handles keys with empty arrays as values
        map_data = {'a': [], 'b': [1, 2]}
        expected = []
        self.assertEqual(generate_combinations(map_data), expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of Changes:
Imports:
unittest is imported instead of Jest for Python test cases.
The generate_combinations function is assumed to be defined elsewhere or imported from the module you are working with.
Test Class:
TestGenerateCombinations is a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. It defines each of the test cases as methods.
Test Method Naming:
Test method names are written in snake_case as per Python's convention.
Assertions:
assertEqual is used instead of Jest’s expect().toEqual(). This is the Python equivalent for testing that two values are equal.
Map Data Representation:
Python dictionaries ({}) are used instead of JavaScript's Map. Since both structures are similar in functionality (key-value mappings), they work interchangeably for this use case.
Empty Map Handling:
The empty map case ({}) is handled with an empty dictionary in Python. This returns [[]] as expected.
Running the Tests:
To run the tests, save this code in a Python file (e.g., test_generate_combinations.py) and run it using the following command:
bash
python -m unittest test_generate_combinations.py
