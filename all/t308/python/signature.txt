To convert the JavaScript function signature with comments into Python, you would typically include a docstring that describes the function's purpose and its return type. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
python
def get_current_date() -> str:
    """Gets the current date and returns it as YYYY-MM-DD.

    Returns:
        str: The current date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation:
Function Signature: The function is defined as get_current_date() with a return type annotation -> str, indicating that it returns a string.
Docstring: The docstring (enclosed in triple quotes) provides a description of what the function does and specifies the return type, similar to the comments in the JavaScript code.
Placeholder: The pass statement is used as a placeholder, indicating that the function is currently not implemented.
You can fill in the function body later with the appropriate logic for getting the current date.
