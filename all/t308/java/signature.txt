Hereâ€™s how you can convert the JavaScript code signature to a Java code signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Gets the current date and returns it as YYYY-MM-DD
 *
 * @return The current date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
 */
public static String getCurrentDate() {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The method is declared as `public static String` to match the return type and accessibility.
- The `@return` tag in the comment is adjusted to fit Java conventions.
