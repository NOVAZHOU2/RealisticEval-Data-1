Certainly! Below is the C++ code with the same function signature and comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current date and returns it as YYYY-MM-DD
 *
 * @return std::string The current date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
 */
std::string getCurrentDate();
```

This C++ function signature matches the original JavaScript function in terms of its name, return type, and documentation comment.
