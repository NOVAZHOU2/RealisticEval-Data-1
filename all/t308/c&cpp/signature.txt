Hereâ€™s how you can convert the JavaScript function signature and comments to C++ while keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
/**
 * Gets the current date and returns it as YYYY-MM-DD
 *
 * @returns The current date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
 */
std::string getCurrentDate() {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

This maintains the structure of the comments and defines the function in C++. The return type is `std::string`, as C++ doesn't use the `{}` syntax for return types like JavaScript does.
