To convert the provided JavaScript code signature to a Python code signature, you need to adjust the syntax to fit Python's conventions. Here's how the code signature would look in Python:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Converts HTML heading tags (h1-h6) to corresponding Markdown headings.
 *
 * @param {string} html - The HTML string containing headings.
 * @returns {string} - The converted Markdown string.
 */
function convertHtmlHeadingsToMarkdown(html) {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def convert_html_headings_to_markdown(html: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts HTML heading tags (h1-h6) to corresponding Markdown headings.

    Args:
        html (str): The HTML string containing headings.

    Returns:
        str: The converted Markdown string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation of the Changes:
Function Definition:
In Python, function definitions use the def keyword followed by the function name, which is typically written in snake_case (e.g., convert_html_headings_to_markdown).
Type Annotations:
Python uses type annotations to specify the types of parameters and return values. In this case, html: str indicates that the html parameter should be a string, and -> str indicates that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
Instead of using JSDoc comments, Python uses triple quotes (""") to create a docstring, which serves as the documentation for the function. The docstring describes the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.
Placeholder Implementation:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function's implementation, similar to an empty body in JavaScript.
This conversion maintains the original meaning and purpose of the JavaScript code while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
