# Description:
#  Jax implementation of hash encoding for accelerated implicit neural representation for 1D-4D scenes.
#  Our implementation is based on the paper:
#    MÃ¼ller, Thomas, et al. "Instant neural graphics primitives with a multiresolution hash encoding." ACM transactions
#     on graphics (TOG) 41.4 (2022): 1-15.
#  with a lot of references from this pytorch implementation:
#    https://github.com/yashbhalgat/HashNeRF-pytorch/blob/main/utils.py
