Here is the JavaScript version of your Python code signature:

```javascript
/**
 * Convert Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to a rotation matrix.
 *
 * @param {number} roll - Rotation around the x-axis in degrees.
 * @param {number} pitch - Rotation around the y-axis in degrees.
 * @param {number} yaw - Rotation around the z-axis in degrees.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} A 3x3 rotation matrix.
 */
```

Please note that in JavaScript, we use JSDoc for documentation and there isn't a direct equivalent to Python's `numpy` library. Instead, you would typically use arrays or libraries like `mathjs`.
