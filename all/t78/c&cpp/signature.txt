Certainly! Below is the C++ version of the provided Python code signature, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cmath>

/**
 * Convert Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to a rotation matrix.
 *
 * @param roll The rotation around the x-axis in degrees.
 * @param pitch The rotation around the y-axis in degrees.
 * @param yaw The rotation around the z-axis in degrees.
 * @return A 3x3 rotation matrix as a std::array<std::array<double, 3>, 3>.
 */
std::array<std::array<double, 3>, 3> eulerToRotationMatrix(double roll, double pitch, double yaw);
```

This C++ function signature includes the necessary headers (`<array>` and `<cmath>`) and follows the same structure as the original Python function, with appropriate type conversions for the input parameters and return type.
