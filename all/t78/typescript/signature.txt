Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to a rotation matrix.
 *
 * @param roll - Rotation around the x-axis in degrees.
 * @param pitch - Rotation around the y-axis in degrees.
 * @param yaw - Rotation around the z-axis in degrees.
 * @returns A 3x3 rotation matrix.
 */
function eulerToRotationMatrix(roll: number, pitch: number, yaw: number): number[][] {
```

Note that in TypeScript, we use `number` instead of `float`, and arrays are represented using `number[]`. Also, we need to specify the return type as `number[][]` because TypeScript doesn't have a direct equivalent for NumPy arrays.
