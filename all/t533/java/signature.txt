Certainly! Below is the Java code signature equivalent to your JavaScript function, keeping the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to shuffle.
 * @return A new string with the characters shuffled.
 */
public static String shuffleString(String inputString) {
}
```

This Java method signature includes:
- `public static`: This means the method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- `String`: This specifies that the method returns a string.
- `shuffleString`: This is the name of the method.
- `(String inputString)`: This indicates that the method takes one parameter, which is a string named `inputString`.
