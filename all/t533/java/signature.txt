Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to shuffle.
 * @return A new string with the characters shuffled.
 */
public String shuffleString(String inputString) {
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same structure and includes the Javadoc comment that describes the purpose of the method, its parameters, and its return value.
