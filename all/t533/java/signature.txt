Here's the Java code signature with comments converted from the JavaScript code you provided:

```java
/**
 * Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to shuffle.
 * @return A new string with the characters shuffled.
 */
public static String shuffleString(String inputString) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the same structure and comments as your original JavaScript code. Let me know if you need further modifications!
