Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the JavaScript function `shuffleString`, including the comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.
 *
 * @param inputString - The string to shuffle.
 * @return A new string with the characters shuffled.
 */
std::string shuffleString(const std::string& inputString);
```

This C++ function takes a constant reference to a `std::string` as its parameter and returns a `std::string`. The comments remain the same to provide documentation about the function's purpose and parameters.
