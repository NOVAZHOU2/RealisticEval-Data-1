Certainly! Below is the Python code signature for the function `shuffle_string` that mimics the JavaScript function you provided, including the docstring:

```python
import random

def shuffle_string(input_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.

    :param input_string: The string to shuffle.
    :type input_string: str
    :return: A new string with the characters shuffled.
    :rtype: str
    """
```

This Python function has the same parameters and return type as the original JavaScript function, along with the corresponding docstring.
