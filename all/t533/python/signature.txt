To convert the provided JavaScript code signature and documentation to a Python function signature with appropriate docstring, you can follow this format:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.
 *
 * @param {string} inputString - The string to shuffle.
 * @returns {string} A new string with the characters shuffled.
 */
function shuffleString(inputString) {}
Python Code Signature
python
def shuffle_string(input_string: str) -> str:
    """Shuffles the characters in a given string randomly.

    Args:
        input_string (str): The string to shuffle.

    Returns:
        str: A new string with the characters shuffled.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation
Function Definition:
def shuffle_string(input_string: str) -> str: defines a function named shuffle_string that takes a single parameter, input_string, which is expected to be of type str, and returns a string.
Docstring:
The docstring uses triple quotes (""") and follows a similar structure to the JavaScript comment. It specifies:
A brief description of what the function does.
The parameter (input_string), its type (str), and a brief description.
The return value (str) and its description.
Function Implementation:
The pass statement indicates that the function body is yet to be implemented, which is common in Python when defining a function's signature without providing the logic immediately.
This signature can be directly used in a Python program where you plan to implement the logic for shuffling characters later.
