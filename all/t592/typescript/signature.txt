Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature with comments converted to TypeScript style:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Performs a mathematical operation on two operands.
 *
 * This function takes two number values and an operator string, and performs
 * the specified arithmetic operation. Supported operations include addition,
 * subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
 *
 * @param a The first operand (number).
 * @param b The second operand (number).
 * @param op A string representing the operation to perform:
 *            '+' for addition,
 *            '-' for subtraction,
 *            '*' for multiplication,
 *            '/' for division,
 *            '^' for exponentiation.
 *
 * @returns The result of the operation as a number.
 *
 * @throws Error if the operator is not recognized or if
 *         there is an attempt to divide by zero.
 */
function applyOp(a: number, b: number, op: string): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Type Annotations**: Changed `double` to `number` and `char` to `string`.
2. **Return Type**: Used `number` for the return type.
3. **Error Handling**: Updated comments to reflect the use of `Error` in TypeScript.
