Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature converted to Python, with the comments translated into Python style:
python
import math

def apply_op(a: float, b: float, op: str) -> float:
    """
    @brief Performs a mathematical operation on two operands.

    This function takes two double values and an operator character, and performs
    the specified arithmetic operation. Supported operations include addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

    @param a: The first operand (float).
    @param b: The second operand (float).
    @param op: A character representing the operation to perform:
                '+' for addition,
                '-' for subtraction,
                '*' for multiplication,
                '/' for division,
                '^' for exponentiation.

    @return: The result of the operation as a float.

    @raises ValueError: if the operator is not recognized or if
                        there is an attempt to divide by zero.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Key Changes:
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def in Python, with type hints for the parameters and return type.
Comment Style:
The C++ comment style (/** ... */) has been converted to a Python docstring format (""" ... """) to maintain the same descriptive style.
The type of the parameters and the return type are specified using Python type hints (float for double and str for char).
Exceptions:
Instead of std::invalid_argument, the exception is indicated as ValueError, which is the Python equivalent.
This structure retains the functionality and intent of the original C++ function signature, while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
