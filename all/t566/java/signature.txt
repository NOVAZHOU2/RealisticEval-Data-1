Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments that mirrors your TypeScript function:

```java
/**
 * Checks if two timestamps correspond to the same day.
 *
 * @param timestamp1 - The first timestamp to compare.
 * @param timestamp2 - The second timestamp to compare.
 * @return True if both timestamps are on the same day, false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean isSameDay(long timestamp1, long timestamp2) {
}
```

This maintains the original comments and adjusts the parameter types and return type accordingly.
