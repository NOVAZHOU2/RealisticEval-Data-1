Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the TypeScript function you provided. This code checks if two timestamps correspond to the same day by comparing the year, month, and day of both timestamps.
python
from datetime import datetime

def is_same_day(timestamp1: int, timestamp2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if two timestamps correspond to the same day.

    :param timestamp1: The first timestamp to compare.
    :param timestamp2: The second timestamp to compare.
    :returns: True if both timestamps are on the same day, false otherwise.
    """
    # Convert timestamps to datetime objects
    date1 = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp1)
    date2 = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp2)

    # Compare the year, month, and day of both datetime objects
    return (date1.year == date2.year and
            date1.month == date2.month and
            date1.day == date2.day)

# Example usage
timestamp1 = 1633072800  # Example timestamp (Unix time)
timestamp2 = 1633159200  # Example timestamp (Unix time)
print(is_same_day(timestamp1, timestamp2))  # Output: True or False
Explanation
Imports: The datetime module is imported to handle date and time operations.
Function Definition: The function is_same_day takes two integer timestamps as input.
Conversion: Each timestamp is converted to a datetime object using datetime.fromtimestamp().
Comparison: It checks if the year, month, and day of both dates are the same, returning True if they are and False otherwise.
