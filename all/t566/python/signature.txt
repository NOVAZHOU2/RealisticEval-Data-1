Sure! Hereâ€™s the Python function signature that corresponds to your TypeScript code, along with the code comments retained:
python
def is_same_day(timestamp1: int, timestamp2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if two timestamps correspond to the same day.

    :param timestamp1: The first timestamp to compare.
    :param timestamp2: The second timestamp to compare.
    :returns: True if both timestamps are on the same day, false otherwise.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name: The function is named is_same_day, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameters: The types for the parameters are specified as int, indicating that both timestamp1 and timestamp2 are integers.
Return Type: The return type is specified as bool, indicating that the function returns a boolean value.
Docstring: The comments from the TypeScript code are converted into a Python docstring format using triple quotes (""").
You can fill in the implementation inside the function body where it says pass. Let me know if you need any more assistance!
