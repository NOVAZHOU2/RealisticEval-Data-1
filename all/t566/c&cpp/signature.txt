Here's the C++ code signature with the comments retained:

```cpp
/**
 * Checks if two timestamps correspond to the same day.
 *
 * @param timestamp1 - The first timestamp to compare.
 * @param timestamp2 - The second timestamp to compare.
 * @returns True if both timestamps are on the same day, false otherwise.
 */
bool isSameDay(std::time_t timestamp1, std::time_t timestamp2) {
}
```

This maintains the original comments while adapting the function signature for C++.
