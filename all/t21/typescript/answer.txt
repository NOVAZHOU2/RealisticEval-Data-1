Here is the equivalent TypeScript code:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as diff from 'diff';

function compareFiles(file1Path: string, file2Path: string): string[] {
    /**
     * Compare the contents of two files and print the differences in unified diff format.
     *
     * @param file1Path - Path to the first file.
     * @param file2Path - Path to the second file.
     * @returns A list containing the lines of differences, if any.
     * @throws {Error} If either file does not exist or there is an error reading the files.
     */
    let lines1: string[];
    let lines2: string[];

    try {
        lines1 = fs.readFileSync(file1Path, 'utf8').split('\n');
        lines2 = fs.readFileSync(file2Path, 'utf8').split('\n');
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            throw new Error('One of the files was not found.');
        }
        throw new Error(`Error reading files: ${error.message}`);
    }

    const diffLines = diff.unifiedDiff({
        fromFile: file1Path,
        toFile: file2Path,
        fromFileContent: lines1.join('\n'),
        toFileContent: lines2.join('\n')
    });

    if (diffLines) {
        diffLines.split('\n').forEach(line => console.log(line));
    }

    return diffLines ? diffLines.split('\n') : [];
}

// Example usage
const file1Path = 'path/to/file1.txt';
const file2Path = 'path/to/file2.txt';
compareFiles(file1Path, file2Path);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: 
   - `fs` is used for file system operations.
   - `diff` is a library similar to `difflib` in Python for generating diffs.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `compareFiles` takes two strings (`file1Path` and `file2Path`) and returns an array of strings representing the differences between the files.

3. **Reading Files**:
   - `fs.readFileSync` is used to read the content of the files synchronously.
   - The content is split into lines using `.split('\n')`.

4. **Generating Differences**:
   - `diff.unifiedDiff` generates the unified diff between the two sets of lines.
   - The resulting diff is printed line by line.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If a file is not found, an error is thrown with the message "One of the files was not found."
   - If there is an error reading the files, an error is thrown with the message "Error reading files: {error message}".

6. **Returning Differences**:
   - The function returns the lines of differences as an array of strings.

This TypeScript code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original Python code, with appropriate adjustments for TypeScript's syntax and libraries.
