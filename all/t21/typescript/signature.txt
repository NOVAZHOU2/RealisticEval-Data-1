Certainly! Here is the equivalent TypeScript code with proper type annotations and JSDoc-style documentation comments:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as diff from 'diff';

/**
 * Compare the contents of two files and print the differences in unified diff format.
 *
 * @param file1Path - Path to the first file.
 * @param file2Path - Path to the second file.
 * @returns An array containing the lines of differences, if any.
 * @throws {Error} If either file does not exist or there is an error reading the files.
 */
function compareFiles(file1Path: string, file2Path: string): string[] {
    let lines1: string[];
    let lines2: string[];

    try {
        const file1Content = fs.readFileSync(file1Path, 'utf8');
        const file2Content = fs.readFileSync(file2Path, 'utf8');
        lines1 = file1Content.split('\n');
        lines2 = file2Content.split('\n');
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
            throw new Error('One of the files was not found.');
        }
        throw new Error(`Error reading files: ${error.message}`);
    }

    const diffLines = diff.unifiedDiff({
        fromFile: file1Path,
        toFile: file2Path,
        fromFileContent: lines1.join('\n'),
        toFileContent: lines2.join('\n')
    });

    if (diffLines) {
        diffLines.split('\n').forEach(line => console.log(line));
    }

    return diffLines ? diffLines.split('\n') : [];
}

// Example usage
const file1Path = 'path/to/file1.txt';
const file2Path = 'path/to/file2.txt';
compareFiles(file1Path, file2Path);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**:
   - `fs` is used for file system operations.
   - `diff` is a library similar to `difflib` in Python for generating diffs.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `compareFiles` takes two strings (`file1Path` and `file2Path`) and returns an array of strings representing the differences between the files.

3. **Reading Files**:
   - `fs.readFileSync` is used to read the content of the files synchronously.
   - The content is split into lines using `.split('\n')`.

4. **Generating Differences**:
   - `diff.unifiedDiff` generates the unified diff between the two sets of lines.
   - The resulting diff is printed line by line.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If a file is not found, an error is thrown with the message "One of the files was not found."
   - If there is an error reading the files, an error is thrown with the message "Error reading files: {error message}".

6. **Returning Differences**:
   - The function returns the lines of differences as an array of strings.

7. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The JSDoc comments provide detailed documentation for the function parameters, return type, and possible exceptions.

This TypeScript code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code, with appropriate translations for TypeScript's syntax and conventions.
