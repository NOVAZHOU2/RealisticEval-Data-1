```javascript
/**
 * Compare the contents of two files and return the differences in unified diff format.
 *
 * @param {string} file1Path - Path to the first file.
 * @param {string} file2Path - Path to the second file.
 * @returns {Promise<Array<string>>} - A promise that resolves with a list of difference lines, if any.
 * @throws {Error} - Throws an error if either file does not exist or there's an issue reading the files.
 */
async function compareFiles(file1Path, file2Path) {
  // Implementation here...
}
```

This JavaScript version maintains the structure and intent of the original Python docstring while adapting it for JavaScript syntax and conventions. Note that in JavaScript, we typically use Promises for handling asynchronous operations, so the `compareFiles` function returns a Promise instead of directly returning the result. Error handling is also done using try-catch blocks when calling this function.
