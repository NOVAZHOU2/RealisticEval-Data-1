Sure, here's the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * @brief Compare the contents of two files and print the differences in unified diff format.
 *
 * @param file1_path Path to the first file.
 * @param file2_path Path to the second file.
 * @return std::vector<std::string> A vector containing the lines of differences, if any.
 * @throw std::runtime_error If either file does not exist or there is an error reading the files.
 */
std::vector<std::string> compareFiles(const std::string& file1_path, const std::string& file2_path);
```

This C++ function signature mirrors the Python function in terms of its purpose, parameters, return type, and exception handling. Note that in C++, exceptions are typically used for error handling rather than specific types like `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError`.
