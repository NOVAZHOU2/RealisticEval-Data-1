Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java class, including the methods to generate combinations from a list of lists.
Python Code
python
from typing import List

class Answer:

Explanation
Class Definition: The Answer class in Python serves the same purpose as in Java, encapsulating the functionality to generate combinations.
Method generate_combinations: This method initializes an empty result list and checks if the input is valid (not empty). If valid, it calls the helper method backtrack.
Method backtrack: This method is a recursive function that builds combinations:
It checks if the current combination (temp_list) has reached the size of the input lists. If so, it adds a copy of this combination to the results.
It iterates through the current list, appending each item to temp_list, recursively calling backtrack for the next index, and then removing the last item to backtrack.
Main Function: The if __name__ == "__main__": block provides an example of how to use the class, initializing a sample input and printing the resulting combinations.
This Python implementation closely mirrors the functionality and structure of the original Java code, providing a clear translation into Python's syntax and conventions.
