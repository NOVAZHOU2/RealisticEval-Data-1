Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided Python function signature, complete with JSDoc comments and appropriate type annotations:

```typescript
/**
 * Fixes the indentation of a block of code represented as a string.
 *
 * The function processes the input code line by line, adjusting the 
 * indentation level based on specific keywords and constructs.
 *
 * @param {string} code - A string containing the code whose indentation needs to be fixed.
 * @returns {string} A string with the corrected indentation for the given code.
 */
function fixIndentation(code: string): string {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **JSDoc Comments**: Converted the Python docstring into TypeScript JSDoc format.
2. **Type Annotations**: Ensured the parameter and return types are properly annotated for TypeScript.
3. **Function Structure**: Kept the function structure while focusing only on the signature and documentation. 

This TypeScript signature now accurately reflects the functionality and purpose of the original Python function.
