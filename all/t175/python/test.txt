Here’s how you can convert the provided Java JUnit test cases into Python unittest test cases. The structure will closely follow the original logic while adapting it to Python syntax and conventions.
Java Code
Here’s a brief overview of the original Java code using JUnit:
It defines several test methods to check the functionality of a method fixIndentation from the Answer class.
Each test checks whether the indentation of Python code strings is corrected properly.
Python Code Using unittest
Below is the equivalent Python code using the unittest framework:
python
import unittest

class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def fixIndentation(code):
        # Placeholder for the actual implementation of fixIndentation
        # This should contain the logic to fix the indentation of Python code
        pass

class Tester(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_basic_indentation(self):
        code = (
            "def example_function():\n"
            "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n"
            "if True:\n"
            "print(\"True branch\")\n"
            "else:\n"
            "print(\"False branch\")\n"
            "return\n"
        )

Explanation of the Python Code:
Import Statements: The unittest module is imported to facilitate unit testing.
Answer Class: A placeholder for the fixIndentation method is created to match the Java code structure. You will need to implement the actual logic for this method.
Tester Class: Inherits from unittest.TestCase, providing the testing framework.
Test Methods: Each Java test method has been translated into a Python test method, prefixed with test_ to ensure they are recognized as tests by the unittest framework.
Assertions: The assertEquals method in JUnit is replaced with self.assertEqual in Python, maintaining the same functionality.
Main Block: The standard if __name__ == '__main__': block is added to run the tests when the script is executed directly.
Make sure to implement the logic for the fixIndentation method in the Answer class to ensure the tests can execute correctly.
