To convert the provided Java function signature to Python, we need to maintain the same semantics while adapting to Python's syntax and conventions. Below is the corresponding Python code signature with a docstring that captures the same information.
Python Function Signature
python
def fix_indentation(code: str) -> str:
    """
    Fixes the indentation of a block of code represented as a string.
    
    The function processes the input code line by line, adjusting the 
    indentation level based on specific keywords and constructs.

    Args:
        code (str): A string containing the code whose indentation needs to be fixed.

    Returns:
        str: A string with the corrected indentation for the given code.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Declaration:
The Java method public static String fixIndentation(String code) is translated to a Python function using def fix_indentation(code: str) -> str:. This uses type hints to specify the parameter and return types.
Docstring:
The Java documentation comments (/** ... */) are converted into a Python docstring using triple quotes """ ... """. This is a standard way in Python to document functions and their parameters.
Parameter and Return Types:
The parameter code is typed as str and the return type is also specified as str using the syntax -> str.
Placeholder for Implementation:
A pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function's implementation, which you would replace with the actual logic of the function.
This structure maintains the clarity and functionality of the original Java method while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
