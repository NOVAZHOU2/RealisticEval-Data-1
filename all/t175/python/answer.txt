Here’s how you can convert the given Java method in the Answer class to Python. The Python version will maintain the same functionality while using Python's syntax and conventions.
Converted Python Code

class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def fix_indentation(code: str) -> str:
        lines = code.split("\n")
        fixed_code = []
        current_indent_level = 0
        spaces_per_indent = 4

        for line in lines:
            trimmed_line = line.strip()
            if not trimmed_line:  # Check if the line is empty
                fixed_code.append("")
                continue

            # Adjust current indentation level
            if (trimmed_line.startswith("elif") or
                trimmed_line.startswith("else") or
                trimmed_line.startswith("except") or
                trimmed_line.startswith("finally")):
                current_indent_level -= 1
            
            elif (trimmed_line.startswith("return") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("break") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("continue") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("pass")):
                current_indent_level -= 1

            # Add appropriate indentation
            fixed_code.append(" " * (current_indent_level * spaces_per_indent) + trimmed_line)

            # Increase indent level after lines ending with a colon
            if trimmed_line.endswith(":"):
                current_indent_level += 1
            elif (trimmed_line.startswith("return") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("break") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("continue") or
                  trimmed_line.startswith("pass")):
                current_indent_level -= 1

        return "\n".join(fixed_code)
Explanation of the Conversion:
Class Declaration:
In Python, the class is defined with class Answer:. There’s no need for a package declaration like in Java.
Static Method:
The @staticmethod decorator indicates that fix_indentation is a static method, similar to how it's defined in Java.
String Input and Output:
The method signature fix_indentation(code: str) -> str uses type hints to specify that the input code is a string and the return type is also a string.
List Instead of StringBuilder:
In Python, we use a list (fixed_code) to accumulate the lines of the formatted code. This is more efficient than using string concatenation in a loop.
Line Processing:
The loop iterates over the lines, trimming them with strip(), and checks for empty lines.
Adjustments for the current indentation level are made based on the same conditions as in the Java code.
Indentation is added by multiplying a string of spaces, " " * (current_indent_level * spaces_per_indent).
Joining the Lines:
Finally, the fixed lines are joined with "\n".join(fixed_code) to create the final string output.
Usage Example
You can call this method in Python as follows:
python
code = """
def my_function():
if condition:
do_something()
elif other_condition:
do_something_else()
"""
fixed_code = Answer.fix_indentation(code)
print(fixed_code)
This would process the given code string and return it with correct indentation.
