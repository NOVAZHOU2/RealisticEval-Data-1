Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript code with the JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Fixes the indentation of a block of code represented as a string.
 *
 * The function processes the input code line by line, adjusting the 
 * indentation level based on specific keywords and constructs.
 *
 * @param {string} code - A string containing the code whose indentation needs to be fixed.
 * @returns {string} - A string with the corrected indentation for the given code.
 */
function fixIndentation(code) {
    // Function logic goes here
}
```
