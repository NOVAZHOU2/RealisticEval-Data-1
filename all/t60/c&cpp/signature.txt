Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Find the common columns of all CSV files in a directory and return these column names as a vector.
 *
 * @param directory The directory path containing the CSV files.
 * @return A vector containing the names of the common columns.
 */
std::vector<std::string> findCommonColumns(const std::string& directory);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same structure and purpose as your Python function, including the use of `std::vector` for returning a list of strings.
