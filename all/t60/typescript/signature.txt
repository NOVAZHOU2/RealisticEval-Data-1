Sure! Here is the equivalent TypeScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```typescript
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

/**
 * Find the common columns of all CSV files in a directory and return these column names as an array.
 *
 * @param directory - The directory path.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the list of common column names.
 */
async function findCommonColumns(directory: string): Promise<string[]> {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript code includes the necessary imports for file system operations and path handling, and it defines the `findCommonColumns` function with the same parameters and return type as your original Python function.
