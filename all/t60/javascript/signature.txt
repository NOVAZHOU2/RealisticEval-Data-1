Here is the equivalent JavaScript code with the same function signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * find the common columns of all csv files in a directory and return these column names as an array
 * @param {string} directory - directory path
 * @returns {Array}
 */
function findCommonColumns(directory) {
    
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function will depend on how you're reading and parsing your CSV files in Node.js or any other JavaScript environment. This signature only declares the type of parameters and return value.
