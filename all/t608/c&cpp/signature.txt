Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature with comments converted appropriately:

```cpp
// Checks whether the given string is a valid email address.
/*
 * Args:
 *     email (std::string): The string to be checked.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     bool: True if the string is a valid email address, False otherwise.
 */
bool is_valid_email(const std::string& email);
```
