Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Java class and methods into Python code. The Python version will utilize the re module for regular expressions, similar to how the Java code uses the Pattern class.
Converted Python Code
python
import re

class Answer:
    # Regular expression for validating an email address
    EMAIL_REGEX = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    EMAIL_PATTERN = re.compile(EMAIL_REGEX)

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
        """Checks whether the given string is a valid email address.
        
        Args:
            email (str): The string to be checked.
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if the string is a valid email address, False otherwise.
        """
        if email is None:  # Python uses None instead of null
            return False  # None is not a valid email
        return bool(Answer.EMAIL_PATTERN.match(email))

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Test the email validation function
    email1 = "example@test.com"
    email2 = "invalid-email@.com"
    print(f"{email1} is valid: {Answer.is_valid_email(email1)}")  # Should return True
    print(f"{email2} is valid: {Answer.is_valid_email(email2)}")  # Should return False
Explanation of the Conversion:
Imports: The Java Pattern class is replaced by Python's re module. The re.compile() method is used to compile the regular expression.
Class Definition: The Answer class in Java is directly translated into a Python class.
Class Variables: The EMAIL_REGEX and EMAIL_PATTERN variables are defined as class variables (attributes) in Python. The regex pattern is stored as a raw string (using r'...') to avoid issues with backslashes.
Static Method: The isValidEmail method in Java is defined as a static method in Python using the @staticmethod decorator.
Parameter Type Hinting: The function parameter is annotated with str, and the return type is indicated as bool for clarity.
Null Check: The Java null check is replaced by a check against None in Python.
Email Validation: The method uses match() from the re module to check if the email matches the compiled pattern, and the result is converted to a boolean.
Main Block: The if __name__ == '__main__': block allows for testing the email validation directly when the script is run. This block contains example usage similar to the Java main method, printing the results of email validations.
This Python code achieves the same functionality as the original Java code while following Python conventions and best practices.
