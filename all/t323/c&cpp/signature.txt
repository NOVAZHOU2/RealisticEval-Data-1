Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments based on the provided JavaScript:

```cpp
/**
 * Verify that a string is a valid username and check that the username contains only letters, numbers, and underscores.
 *
 * @param username - The username to be validated.
 * @returns true if the username matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid;
 *          returns false if the username contains any characters outside of letters, numbers, and underscores.
 */
bool isValidUsername(const std::string& username) {
}
```

This maintains the original structure and comments while adapting it to C++.
