Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Verify that a string is a valid username and check that the username contains only letters, numbers, and underscores.
 *
 * @param username - The username to be validated.
 * @return bool - Returns true if the username matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid;
 *                returns false if the username contains any characters outside of letters, numbers, and underscores.
 */
bool isValidUsername(const std::string& username);
```

This function takes a `std::string` as input and returns a `bool`. It checks if the username consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores using regular expressions (regex).
