Here's how you can translate the JavaScript function signature into Java, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Verify that a string is a valid username and check that the username contains only letters, numbers, and underscores.
 *
 * @param username - The username to be validated.
 * @return true if the username matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid; 
 *         false if the username contains any characters outside of letters, numbers, and underscores.
 */
public boolean isValidUsername(String username) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This Java method signature maintains the same functionality and documentation as your original JavaScript function. It specifies that the method `isValidUsername` takes one parameter (`username`) of type `String` and returns a boolean value. The docstring provides a brief description of what the method does and its expected behavior.
