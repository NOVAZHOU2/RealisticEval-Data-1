Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, including appropriate Java method signatures, type conversions, and Javadoc comments:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.*;

/**
 * Achieves topological sorting based on depth-first search.
 *
 * @param vertices A list of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
 * @param edges A list of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge in the graph
 *              and is formed as (start_vertex, end_vertex).
 * @return A list of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
 *         and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty list is returned.

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.

2. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined with the necessary imports.

3. **Javadoc Comments**: The method `topologicalSortDFS` includes detailed Javadoc comments that explain the purpose, parameters, and return value of the method.

4. **Method Signature**: The method signature `public static List<Integer> topologicalSortDFS(List<Integer> vertices, List<int[]> edges)` matches the Python function signature, with appropriate Java types.

5. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using a `Map<Integer, List<Integer>>` where the key is a vertex and the value is a list of its neighbors.

6. **Visited Set**: A `HashSet<Integer>` is used to keep track of visited nodes during the depth-first search.

7. **Result**: An `ArrayDeque<Integer>` is used to store the result in reverse order (topological sort).

8. **Recursive DFS Helper Class**: A nested class `DFSHelper` is defined to perform the recursive depth-first search. This helps encapsulate the recursive logic and keeps the code organized.

9. **Main Method**: A simple `main` method is included to demonstrate how to call the `topologicalSortDFS` method and print the result.

This Java code preserves the functionality and structure of the original Python code while adhering to Java's syntax and conventions.
