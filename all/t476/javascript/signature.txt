Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Achieves topological sorting based on depth-first search (DFS).
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} vertices - A list of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
 * @param {Array<[number, number]>} edges - A list of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge
 *                                          in the graph and is formed as [start_vertex, end_vertex].
 * @returns {Array<number>} - A list of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
 *                            and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty array is returned.
 */
function topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges) {
    const graph = new Map();
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = [];  // Use an array to store the result

    // Build the graph
    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
        graph.get(u).push(v);
    });

    // Recursive depth-first search function
    function dfs(node) {
        if (visited.has(node)) return;
        visited.add(node);
        if (graph.has(node)) {
            graph.get(node).forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    dfs(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }
        result.unshift(node);  // Add the node to the front of the result array
    }

    // Traverse all nodes
    vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        if (!visited.has(vertex)) {
            dfs(vertex);
        }
    });

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]];
console.log(topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges));
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Signature**: The function signature is defined with JSDoc comments to describe the parameters and return type.
- **JSDoc Comments**: The comments are rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards, providing clear descriptions of the function, parameters, and return value.
- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using a `Map` object in JavaScript, which is equivalent to the `defaultdict` in Python.
- **Visited Set**: A `Set` is used to keep track of visited nodes, similar to the Python version.
- **Result Storage**: An array (`result`) is used to store the final topological order. Elements are prepended to the array to simulate the behavior of a deque.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The DFS function is implemented recursively, visiting each neighbor and adding the current node to the result after all its neighbors have been processed.

This JavaScript code preserves the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code while adhering to JavaScript documentation standards.
