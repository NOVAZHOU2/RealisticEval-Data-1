Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Achieves topological sorting based on depth-first search (DFS).
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} vertices - An array of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
 * @param {Array<[number, number]>} edges - An array of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge
 *                                          in the graph and is formed as [start_vertex, end_vertex].
 * @returns {Array<number>} - An array of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
 *                            and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty array is returned.
 */
function topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges) {
    const graph = new Map();
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = []; // Use an array to store the result

    // Build the graph
    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        if (!graph.has(u)) {
            graph.set(u, []);
        }
        graph.get(u).push(v);
    });

    // Recursive depth-first search function
    function dfs(node) {
        if (visited.has(node)) {
            return;
        }
        visited.add(node);
        if (graph.has(node)) {
            graph.get(node).forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    dfs(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }
        result.unshift(node); // Add the node to the front of the result array
    }

    // Traverse all nodes
    vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        if (!visited.has(vertex)) {
            dfs(vertex);
        }
    });

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]];
console.log(topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges));
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function signature is annotated with JSDoc comments.
   - The parameters `vertices` and `edges` are documented with their types.
   - The return type is also documented.

2. **Comments and Documentation**:
   - The function description and argument descriptions are written in JSDoc format.
   - The return value description is also formatted according to JSDoc standards.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The `graph` is represented using a `Map`.
   - The `visited` set tracks visited nodes.
   - The `result` array stores the final topological order.
   - The `dfs` function performs a recursive depth-first search and adds nodes to the `result` array.

This JavaScript code preserves the structure and functionality of the original Python code while adhering to JSDoc standards for documentation.
