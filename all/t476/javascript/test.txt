Certainly! Below is the equivalent Jest test class for the given Python unittest test class. I will provide the Jest test suite and ensure that the functionality and logic of the tests are maintained.

### Python Unittest Code

```python
import unittest
from typing import List, Tuple

def topological_sort_dfs(vertices: List[int], edges: List[Tuple]) -> List:
    """
    Achieve topological sorting based on depth-first search (DFS).

    Args:
        vertices (List[int]): A list of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
        edges (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge
                                       in the graph and is formed as (start_vertex, end_vertex).

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
                   and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty list is returned.
    """
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    visited = set()
    result = deque()

    # Build the graph
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    # Recursive depth-first search function
    def dfs(node):
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        result.appendleft(node)

    # Traverse all nodes
    for vertex in vertices:
        if vertex not in visited:
            dfs(vertex)

    return list(result)


class TestTopologicalSort(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_topological_sort(self):
        vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
        expected = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # The actual order may vary, but it should be a valid topological sort
        self.assertEqual(topological_sort_dfs(vertices, edges), expected)

        vertices = [1, 2, 3]
        edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]
        expected = []  # Graph contains a cycle, so the result should be an empty list
        self.assertEqual(topological_sort_dfs(vertices, edges), expected)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Equivalent Jest Test Class

Here is the equivalent Jest test class:

```javascript
const topologicalSortDFS = require('./topologicalSortDFS'); // Import the function

describe('topologicalSortDFS', () => {
    it('should correctly perform topological sort without cycles', () => {
        const vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]];
        const expected = [1, 2, 3, 4];  // The actual order may vary, but it should be a valid topological sort
        expect(topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges)).toEqual(expected);
    });

    it('should return an empty list when the graph contains a cycle', () => {
        const vertices = [1, 2, 3];
        const edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1]];
        const expected = [];
        expect(topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges)).toEqual(expected);
    });
});

// Implementation of the topologicalSortDFS function
function topologicalSortDFS(vertices, edges) {
    const graph = new Map();
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = [];

    // Build the graph
    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        if (!graph.has(u)) {
            graph.set(u, []);
        }
        graph.get(u).push(v);
    });

    // Recursive depth-first search function
    function dfs(node) {
        if (visited.has(node)) {
            return;
        }
        visited.add(node);
        if (graph.has(node)) {
            graph.get(node).forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    dfs(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }
        result.unshift(node); // Add the node to the front of the result array
    }

    // Traverse all nodes
    vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        if (!visited.has(vertex)) {
            dfs(vertex);
        }
    });

    return result;
}

module.exports = topologicalSortDFS;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Jest Test Suite**:
   - The `describe` block defines the test suite for the `topologicalSortDFS` function.
   - Each `it` block represents a specific test case.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case (`test_topological_sort`) checks the topological sort for a graph without cycles.
   - The second test case (`should return an empty list when the graph contains a cycle`) checks the topological sort for a graph with cycles.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The `expect` function is used with `toEqual` to compare the results with the expected values.

4. **Implementation**:
   - The `topologicalSortDFS` function is implemented in JavaScript, maintaining the same logic and structure as the Python version.
   - The `Map` object is used to represent the graph.
   - The `Set` object is used to track visited nodes.
   - The `result` array stores the final topological order.

This Jest test class ensures that the functionality and logic of the tests are maintained while adhering to Jest standards.
