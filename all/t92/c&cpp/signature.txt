Hereâ€™s the C++ version of the function signature, including the comments you provided:

```cpp
/**
 * Decodes HTML entities in a given HTML string.
 * @param htmlString The HTML string containing entities to decode.
 * @returns The decoded string with HTML entities converted back to their original characters.
 */
std::string replaceHtmlEntities(const std::string& htmlString) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from your JavaScript code while adapting it to C++. Let me know if you need anything else!
