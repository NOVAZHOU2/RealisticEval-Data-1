Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments, translated from your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Decodes HTML entities in a given HTML string.
 * @param htmlString The HTML string containing entities to decode.
 * @return The decoded string with HTML entities converted back to their original characters.
 */
public static String replaceHtmlEntities(String htmlString) {
}
```

This signature maintains the structure and comments from the JavaScript version.
