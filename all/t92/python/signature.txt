To translate the JavaScript code signature, including the JSDOM setup, into Python code, we’ll focus on the function definition and docstring, along with any necessary imports. Below is the equivalent Python code signature that captures the purpose and functionality described in your JavaScript example.
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Decodes HTML entities in a given HTML string.
 * @param {string} htmlString - The HTML string containing entities to decode.
 * @returns {string} The decoded string with HTML entities converted back to their original characters.
 */
const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');
const dom = new JSDOM();
const { document } = dom.window;

function replaceHtmlEntities(htmlString) {}
Converted Python Code Signature
python
import html

def replace_html_entities(html_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Decodes HTML entities in a given HTML string.

    Args:
        html_string (str): The HTML string containing entities to decode.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string with HTML entities converted back to their original characters.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Breakdown of the Conversion:
Imports:
We import the html module from the Python standard library, which is useful for decoding HTML entities.
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def, following Python’s naming conventions (snake_case for function names).
It accepts a parameter html_string annotated with the type str.
Docstring:
A detailed docstring is provided, similar to the JavaScript comment, to describe the function’s purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
Placeholder:
The pass statement acts as a placeholder for the function's implementation, indicating that the function is defined but not yet implemented.
Final Implementation
If you later implement the replace_html_entities function as described earlier, it would look like this:
python
import html

def replace_html_entities(html_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Decodes HTML entities in a given HTML string.

    Args:
        html_string (str): The HTML string containing entities to decode.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string with HTML entities converted back to their original characters.
    """
    if not isinstance(html_string, str):
        raise TypeError('Input must be a string.')

    # Decode HTML entities
    return html.unescape(html_string)
This complete implementation matches the functionality of the JavaScript version while adhering to Python standards and practices.
