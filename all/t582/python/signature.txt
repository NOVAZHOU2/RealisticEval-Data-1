Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature converted to Python, including the code comments:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def to_query_string(params: dict) -> str:
    """
    Converts an object to a query string.
    
    For example:
        input: { 'search': 'test', 'page': 1, 'size': 10 }
        output: '?search=test&page=1&size=10'

    :param params: The parameters to convert.
    :type params: dict
    :return: The query string.
    :rtype: str
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the function implementation
Key Changes Explained:
Function Signature:
The function is defined using def in Python.
The type of params is specified as dict, which is the equivalent of Record<string, any> in TypeScript.
The return type is specified as str, just like in TypeScript.
Docstring:
The docstring uses triple quotes to document the function in Python.
The comments from the TypeScript code have been adapted to Python formatting while maintaining the original explanations.
Type Annotations:
The :type and :rtype annotations provide additional clarity about the expected input and output types, which is common in Python docstrings.
Placeholder:
A pass statement is included as a placeholder for the function implementation.
This Python function signature maintains the same functionality as the original TypeScript version, while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
