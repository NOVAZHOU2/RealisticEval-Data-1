Sure, here's how you can convert your Python unittest test class into a Java JUnit test case. I'll assume that you have some tests for the `read_mapping_file` function in your Python unittest class.

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import java.io.File;
import java.util.List;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Tester {

    private String mappingFilePath = "path/to/your/mapping/file.txt";

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Set up any necessary resources or configurations before running tests
    }

    @Test
    public void testReadMappingFile() {
        try {
            List<String> result = readMappingFile(mappingFilePath);
            assertNotNull("Result should not be null", result);
            assertTrue("Result should not be empty", !result.isEmpty());
            // Add more assertions based on expected behavior
        } catch (Exception e) {
            fail("An exception occurred while reading the mapping file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    // Assuming readMappingFile method is implemented in a separate class called MappingReader
    private List<String> readMappingFile(String filePath) throws Exception {
        // Implementation of readMappingFile goes here
        return null; // Replace with actual implementation
    }
}
```

In this Java JUnit test case:

1. The package name is set to `org.real.temp`.
2. The test class is named `Tester`.
3. A `setUp` method is provided to set up any necessary resources or configurations before running tests.
4. A `testReadMappingFile` method is included to test the `readMappingFile` function. It uses JUnit assertions to verify that the result is not null and is not empty.
5. The `readMappingFile` method is assumed to be implemented in a separate class called `MappingReader`. You need to replace the placeholder implementation with the actual logic.

Make sure to adjust the `mappingFilePath` variable to point to the correct path of your mapping file. Also, add more assertions based on the expected behavior of your `readMappingFile` function.
