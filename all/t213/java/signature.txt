Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ImageUtils {
    /**
     * Apply the im2col operation to an input image.
     *
     * @param image The input image of shape (C, H, W) where:
     *              C: Number of channels
     *              H: Height of the image
     *              W: Width of the image
     * @param filterHeight Height of the filter
     * @param filterWidth Width of the filter
     * @param stride Stride of the filter
     * @param padding Number of pixels to pad the input image
     * @return col A 2D array where each column is a flattened filter region
     */
    public static int[][][] im2col(int[][][] image, int filterHeight, int filterWidth, int stride, int padding) {
        // Implementation goes here
        return new int[0][];
    }
}
```

Please note that in Java, arrays are zero-indexed and there isn't a direct equivalent for `numpy`'s dynamic typing. Therefore, we need to define the dimensions of our arrays explicitly. Also, Java doesn't support function overloading like Python, so you would typically handle different cases with separate methods or using varargs. Additionally, error handling should be added according to your requirements.
