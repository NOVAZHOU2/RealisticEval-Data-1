To convert the provided Java method signature to a Python function signature, we need to consider Python's syntax and conventions. Here’s how the Java function can be translated into Python:
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Finds all prime numbers within a specified range.
 *
 * @param lowerBound the lower bound of the range (inclusive), must be greater than 0
 * @param upperBound the upper bound of the range (inclusive), must be greater than or equal to lowerBound
 * @return a List<Integer> containing all prime numbers in the specified range
 *         If no prime numbers are found, an empty list is returned.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if lowerBound is greater than upperBound
 */
public static List<Integer> findPrimes(int lowerBound, int upperBound) {}
Python Equivalent Function Signature
In Python, we typically use lists and raise exceptions with the raise statement. Here’s how the equivalent function signature would look:
python
def find_primes(lower_bound: int, upper_bound: int) -> list[int]:
    """Finds all prime numbers within a specified range.

    Args:
        lower_bound (int): The lower bound of the range (inclusive), must be greater than 0.
        upper_bound (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive), must be greater than or equal to lower_bound.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list containing all prime numbers in the specified range.
                    If no prime numbers are found, an empty list is returned.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If lower_bound is greater than upper_bound.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Key Differences Explained
Function Definition: In Python, we use def instead of the access modifiers (public static) used in Java.
Type Annotations: Python allows type annotations for parameters and return types. Here, int is specified for both lower_bound and upper_bound, and the return type is a list of integers (list[int]).
Docstring: The Java documentation comments (/** ... */) are replaced with a Python docstring (triple quotes) that serves a similar purpose.
Error Handling: Instead of throwing exceptions like in Java, Python uses the raise statement to throw exceptions. Here, I replaced IllegalArgumentException with ValueError as it's a more common exception for value-related errors in Python.
You can fill in the function implementation later to actually find the prime numbers in the specified range.
