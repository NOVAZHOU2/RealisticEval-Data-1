Below is the Python version of the provided Java test cases using the unittest framework. The tests check various scenarios for the find_primes method in the Answer class.
Java Test Cases Breakdown
Each method tests a different scenario related to finding prime numbers.
The Java assertions check if the expected list of prime numbers matches the output from the findPrimes method.
Python Equivalent Test Cases
Here’s how the Java test cases can be converted to Python using unittest:
python
import unittest

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_find_primes_between_10_and_50(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(10, 50)
        expected = [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

    def test_find_primes_in_single_number_range(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(5, 5)
        expected = [5]
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

    def test_find_primes_in_empty_range(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(1, 1)
        expected = []
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

    def test_find_primes_in_negative_range(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(-10, -1)
        expected = []
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

    def test_find_primes_from_zero_to_ten(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(0, 10)
        expected = [2, 3, 5, 7]
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

    def test_find_primes_in_range_starting_from_two(self):
        primes = Answer.find_primes(2, 10)
        expected = [2, 3, 5, 7]
        self.assertEqual(expected, primes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
Key Changes Explained
Importing unittest: The unittest module is imported to create the test class and methods.
Class Definition: The Java class Tester is converted to a Python class TestAnswer, which inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Method Naming: Method names in Python typically use snake_case rather than camelCase. Hence, the method names have been changed accordingly.
Assertions: Python’s unittest framework uses self.assertEqual() to compare the expected and actual outputs, similar to assertEquals in JUnit.
Execution: The standard Python convention if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main() is used to run the tests when the script is executed.
Running the Tests
To run these tests:
Save the code to a file, e.g., test_answer.py.
Run the tests using Python with the command:
bash
python -m unittest test_answer.py
This will execute all the test cases and show you the results, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.
