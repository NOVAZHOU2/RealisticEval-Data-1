Here’s how you can convert the provided Java code into Python. The code finds all prime numbers within a given range and has a helper method to check if a number is prime.
Java Code Breakdown
Imports: The Java code uses ArrayList and List from java.util to manage lists.
findPrimes Method: This method finds all prime numbers in a specified range.
isPrime Method: This is a helper method that checks if a number is prime.
main Method: This demonstrates how to use the findPrimes method.
Python Equivalent Code
Here's the equivalent code in Python:
python
import math

class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def find_primes(lower_bound, upper_bound):
        prime_numbers = []  # List to hold prime numbers
        # Loop through the specified range
        for number in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
            # Check if the number is prime
            if Answer.is_prime(number):
                prime_numbers.append(number)  # Add to the list if prime
        return prime_numbers  # Return the list of prime numbers

    @staticmethod
    def is_prime(number):
        if number <= 1:
            return False  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(number)) + 1):
            if number % i == 0:
                return False  # Not prime if divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
        return True  # Number is prime

    @staticmethod
    def main():
        lower_bound = 10
        upper_bound = 50
        primes = Answer.find_primes(lower_bound, upper_bound)
        print(f"Prime numbers between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}: {primes}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Answer.main()
Explanation of the Python Code
Imports: The math module is imported for the square root function.
Class and Static Methods: The methods are defined as @staticmethod, similar to Java’s static methods.
List Handling: Python uses a simple list to store prime numbers.
Loop and Conditionals: The for loop and conditionals are similar to Java, but Python uses range() to generate the sequence of numbers.
Output: The results are printed using formatted strings (f-strings) for better readability.
Usage
To run this code:
Save it to a .py file, for example, answer.py.
Execute it using a Python interpreter with the command:
bash
python answer.py
This will output the prime numbers between 10 and 50, similar to the Java program's functionality.
