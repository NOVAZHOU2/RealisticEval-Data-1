Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ function signature with comments converted appropriately:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/**
 * Reads the content of the file specified by the file path and returns it as a byte array.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the file that needs to be read.
 * @return A vector of chars containing the content of the file.
 */
std::vector<char> read_file_to_byte_array(const std::string& file_path);
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Function Signature**: The Python function is translated to a C++ function, using `std::vector<char>` to represent the byte array.
  
2. **Comments**: The Python docstring is converted to a C++ documentation style comment (`/** ... */`).

3. **Type Annotations**: Python's type annotations are replaced with their C++ equivalents (`str` to `std::string` and `bytes` to `std::vector<char>`).
