Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function signature, including the conversion of the docstring to JSDoc style comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads the content of the file specified by the file path and returns it as a byte array.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the file that needs to be read.
 * @returns {Uint8Array} - A byte array containing the content of the file.
 */
function readFileToByteArray(filePath: string): Uint8Array {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The Python type `str` is translated to `string` in TypeScript.
- The Python return type `bytes` is represented as `Uint8Array` in TypeScript.
- The docstring is converted to a JSDoc comment format.
