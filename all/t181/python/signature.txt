Here's the Python equivalent function signature for the provided Java method:
Java:
java
/*** Reads the content of the file specified by the file path and returns it as a byte array.** 
* @param filePath The path to the file that needs to be read. 
* @return A byte array containing the content of the file. 
* @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs while reading the file. */
public static byte[] readFileToByteArray(String filePath) throws IOException {}
Python:
In Python, you can use the open() function to read a file and return the contents as a byte array. Here's the equivalent Python function signature:
python
import os

def read_file_to_byte_array(file_path: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Reads the content of the file specified by the file path and returns it as a byte array.

    :param file_path: The path to the file that needs to be read.
    :return: A byte array containing the content of the file.
    :raises IOError: If an I/O error occurs while reading the file.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return file.read()
Explanation:
Function name and parameters: The Java function readFileToByteArray is changed to read_file_to_byte_array, following Python's snake_case naming convention. The parameter filePath in Java is file_path in Python.
Return type: In Python, the return type is specified using -> bytes, indicating that the function returns a byte array (or bytes).
Error handling: In Python, I/O errors are raised as IOError (or OSError in newer versions). The method signature in Python doesn't explicitly declare exceptions like in Java; instead, we just mention that it may raise IOError.
File reading: The file is opened in 'rb' mode (read binary) using a context manager (with statement) which automatically handles file closing. The contents of the file are then read using file.read().
