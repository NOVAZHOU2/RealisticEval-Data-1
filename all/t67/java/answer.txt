Here's how you can convert the Python code into Java code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Answer {

    public static Map<String, String> parseXamlToDict(String xamlFilePath) {
        // Here you would add your Java code to parse the XAML file and extract key-value pairs
        // For simplicity, I'll just return an empty map here
        return new HashMap<>();
    }
}
```

This Java code does not include the actual logic for parsing the XAML file because that part depends on the specific structure of your XAML files and what exactly you want to extract. The method `parseXamlToDict` takes a string representing the path to the XAML file and returns a `Map<String, String>` where keys and values are strings. 

Please note that Java does not have built-in support for XML parsing like Python does with its `xml.etree.ElementTree` module. You will need to use a library such as JAXB or a third-party library like JDOM or XStream to parse the XAML file.
