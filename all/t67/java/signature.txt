Here is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided Python function:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Parses an XAML file, extracts the key-value pairs within the String element, and returns the model_answer_result in a dictionary
 *
 * @param xamlFile The path to the XAML file.
 * @return A Map containing the key-value pairs extracted from 'String' elements.
 */
public static Map<String, String> parseXamlToDict(String xamlFile);
```

Please note that Java doesn't have built-in support for XML parsing like Python does with `xml.etree.ElementTree`. Therefore, you would need to use a library such as JAXB or DOM4J to handle the actual parsing of the XAML file.
