Here is the TypeScript version of your Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Converts a file size in bytes to a human-readable format.
 * For example:
 *      input: 2120
 *      output: 2KB
 * @param sizeBytes - The size in bytes to be converted.
 * @returns The converted size in a human-readable format (e.g., "2KB", "1MB").
 */
function convertFileSize(sizeBytes: number): string {
    // ... Your function implementation here ...
}
```

Please note that I've replaced `def` with `function`, changed the type hinting from `int` to `number`, and kept the docstring exactly as it was in your original Python function. Also, make sure to implement the function body in TypeScript according to your needs.
