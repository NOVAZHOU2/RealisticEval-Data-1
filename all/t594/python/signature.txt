Certainly! Below is the converted C++ code signature to Python code signature, keeping the comments and converting them to Python style comments.
C++ Code:
cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::remove_if

/**
 * @brief Splits a comma-separated string into individual tokens.
 *
 * This function takes a string containing comma-separated values, trims
 * leading and trailing whitespace from each token, and stores the non-empty
 * tokens in the provided vector.
 *
 * @param str The input string to be split, which may contain leading and
 *            trailing whitespace around the tokens.
 * @param vect A reference to a vector of strings where the resulting tokens
 *             will be stored. The vector will be cleared before storing
 *             the new tokens.

Explanation:
Function Definition: The C++ function signature void splitComma(const std::string& str, std::vector<std::string>& vect) has been converted to Python as def split_comma(s):.
Docstring: The C++ comments have been converted into a Python docstring format, maintaining the structure and meaning.
Parameter Types: Python does not require explicit type declarations, so str and vect are described in the docstring instead.
List Initialization: The vector in C++ is replaced by a list in Python, which is initialized within the function.
Example Usage: Added a simple example to demonstrate how to call the function.
You can now use the split_comma function in Python!
