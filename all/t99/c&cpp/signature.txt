Sure! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * @description Calculates the sum of all the numbers in a numeric array and returns it as a model_answer_result. For example, if you enter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the return value is 15
 * @param arr - The vector of numbers to sum.
 */
int sum(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function is defined to take a `const std::vector<int>&` as its parameter, which is equivalent to a numeric array in JavaScript.
- The comment format is kept the same for clarity and documentation purposes.
