Certainly! Here’s the Java code signature with the comments preserved, matching the JavaScript code signature you provided:

```java
/**
 * @description Calculates the sum of all the numbers in a numeric array and returns it as a model_answer_result. For example, if you enter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the return value is 15
 * @param arr The array of numbers to sum.
 * @return The sum of all the numbers in the array.
 */
public static int sum(int[] arr) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comments**: The comments are preserved exactly as in the JavaScript code.
2. **Method Signature**:
   - `public static int sum(int[] arr)`: This method takes an array of integers (`int[] arr`) and returns an integer (`int`) representing the sum of the numbers in the array.

You can implement the logic inside the method as needed. Here’s a simple implementation for completeness:

```java
/**
 * @description Calculates the sum of all the numbers in a numeric array and returns it as a model_answer_result. For example, if you enter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the return value is 15
 * @param arr The array of numbers to sum.
 * @return The sum of all the numbers in the array.
 */
public static int sum(int[] arr) {
    if (arr == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Expected a non-null array of numbers");
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Explanation of Implementation:
1. **Null Check**: Ensures that the input array is not null.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Iterates through the array and accumulates the sum of the numbers.

This should give you a complete and functional Java method that matches the JavaScript code signature and comments.
