Here's the Java code signature with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * @description Calculates the sum of all the numbers in a numeric array and returns it as a model_answer_result. For example, if you enter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the return value is 15
 * @param arr The array of numbers to sum.
 */
public static int sum(int[] arr) {
    
}
```

Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
