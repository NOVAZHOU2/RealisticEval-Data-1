Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided C++ code for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) into Python. The Python version retains the original functionality and includes appropriate exception handling.
Converted Python Code
python
class InvalidInputError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for invalid input values."""
    pass

def calculate_bmi(weight: float, height: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.

    The BMI is calculated using the formula:
        BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

    :param weight: The weight of the individual in kilograms.
    :param height: The height of the individual in meters.
    
    :return: The calculated BMI value as a float.

    :raises InvalidInputError: If weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
                               since these values must be positive.
    """
    # Validate weight and height
    if weight <= 0:
        raise InvalidInputError("Weight must be greater than zero.")
    if height <= 0:
        raise InvalidInputError("Height must be greater than zero.")
    
    # Calculate BMI
    bmi = weight / (height * height)
    return bmi  # Return the calculated BMI value
Explanation of Changes:
Exception Handling:
Instead of using std::invalid_argument, we define a custom exception class InvalidInputError to handle invalid inputs. This allows for a more Pythonic way to signal errors.
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def calculate_bmi(weight: float, height: float) -> float: to specify that it takes two float parameters and returns a float.
Docstring:
The C++ comment block has been converted to a Python docstring. The format has been updated to match Python conventions using :param and :return for parameter and return value descriptions.
Input Validation:
The validation checks for weight and height remain, but they raise InvalidInputError with descriptive messages when the input values are invalid.
BMI Calculation:
The calculation logic remains the same, utilizing the formula to compute BMI.
How to Use the Function
You can use the calculate_bmi function like this:
python
try:
    weight = 70  # example weight in kg
    height = 1.75  # example height in meters
    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
    print(f"The calculated BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
except InvalidInputError as e:
    print(e)
This example demonstrates how to call the function, handle potential exceptions, and print the calculated BMI.
