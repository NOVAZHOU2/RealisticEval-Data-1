Hereâ€™s the C++ function signature converted to Python, with the comments modified to follow Python's commenting style:
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def calculate_bmi(weight: float, height: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.

    The BMI is calculated using the formula:
        BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

    :param weight: The weight of the individual in kilograms.
    :param height: The height of the individual in meters.

    :return: The calculated BMI value as a float.

    :raises ValueError: If weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
                       since these values must be positive.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition:
Changed the function name to calculate_bmi, following Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Specified the parameters weight and height as float types and indicated that the function returns a float.
Docstring:
Converted the C++ comment block into a Python docstring using triple quotes ("""). This serves both as documentation and as the place for function comments.
The original C++ comments have been preserved and modified for Python syntax:
@brief is removed since the function name already indicates its purpose.
The @return section is modified to fit Python's style with :return.
The @throws section has been changed to :raises, specifying a ValueError exception for invalid inputs.
Placeholder for Implementation:
Added pass to indicate that the function implementation will be provided later.
This structure follows Python's conventions and keeps the functionality and purpose of the original C++ code intact.
