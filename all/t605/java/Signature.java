/**
 * Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
 *
 * The BMI is calculated using the formula:
 *
 *      BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
 *
 * @param weight The weight of the individual in kilograms.
 * @param height The height of the individual in meters.
 * @return The calculated BMI value as a double.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
 *                                  since these values must be positive.
