Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java code, organized with the specified package name and class structure, along with converted comments in Javadoc format:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * @brief Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
 *
 * The BMI is calculated using the formula:
 *
 *      BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
 *
 * @param weight The weight of the individual in kilograms.
 * @param height The height of the individual in meters.
 * @return The calculated BMI value as a double.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
 *                                  since these values must be positive.
 */
public class Answer {
    
    public static double calculateBMI(double weight, double height) {
        // Validate weight and height
        if (weight <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Weight must be greater than zero.");
        }
        if (height <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Height must be greater than zero.");
        }

        // Calculate BMI
        double bmi = weight / (height * height);
        return bmi; // Return the calculated BMI value
    }
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
- Converted the C++ function into a static method within a class named `Answer`.
- Used `IllegalArgumentException` to replace C++'s `std::invalid_argument`.
- Structured comments in Javadoc format.
