Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature, adapted from the provided C++ code:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
 *
 * The BMI is calculated using the formula:
 *
 *      BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
 *
 * @param {number} weight The weight of the individual in kilograms.
 * @param {number} height The height of the individual in meters.
 *
 * @return {number} The calculated BMI value.
 *
 * @throws {Error} if weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
 *                 since these values must be positive.
 */
function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this conversion:
- The C++ type declarations (e.g., `double`) are replaced with JavaScript's `number` type.
- Memory management conventions (like pointers and dynamic allocation) are not necessary in JavaScript.
- Comments have been converted to JavaScript-style, maintaining the original documentation format.
