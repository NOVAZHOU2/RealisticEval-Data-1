Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
 *
 * The BMI is calculated using the formula:
 *
 *      BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
 *
 * @param {number} weight The weight of the individual in kilograms.
 * @param {number} height The height of the individual in meters.
 *
 * @return {number} The calculated BMI value.
 *
 * @throws {Error} if weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
 *                 since these values must be positive.
 */
function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
    // Validate weight and height
    if (weight <= 0) {
        throw new Error("Weight must be greater than zero.");
    }
    if (height <= 0) {
        throw new Error("Height must be greater than zero.");
    }

    // Calculate BMI
    const bmi = weight / (height * height);
    return bmi; // Return the calculated BMI value
}
```

This version adheres to JavaScript conventions while maintaining the original logic and functionality.
