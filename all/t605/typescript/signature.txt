Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided C++ function signature and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
 *
 * The BMI is calculated using the formula:
 *
 *      BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
 *
 * @param weight The weight of the individual in kilograms.
 * @param height The height of the individual in meters.
 *
 * @returns The calculated BMI value as a number.
 *
 * @throws Error if weight or height is less than or equal to zero,
 *                since these values must be positive.
 */
function calculateBMI(weight: number, height: number): number {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Function Signature**: Converted the C++ `double calculateBMI(double weight, double height)` to `function calculateBMI(weight: number, height: number): number`.
2. **Return Type**: Replaced `double` with `number` in TypeScript.
3. **Comments**: Retained the original C++ comments and converted them to TypeScript format without changes.
4. **Error Handling**: Adjusted the error description to reflect TypeScript conventions (using `Error` instead of `std::invalid_argument`).

This preserves the original functionality and structure while adapting it to TypeScript conventions.
