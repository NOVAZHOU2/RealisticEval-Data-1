To convert the given Python function into its C++ equivalent, we need to define a function that takes a 2D vector of integers (`vector<vector<int>>`) as the matrix and an integer (`int`) as the exponent. The function will return a 2D vector of integers representing the matrix raised to the power of `n`. We will also include the necessary comments and exception handling.

Hereâ€™s the C++ version:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>

/**
 * Computes the n-th power of a matrix using the fast exponentiation method.
 *
 * @param matrix A square matrix to be exponentiated.
 * @param n The exponent to raise the matrix to. Must be a non-negative integer.
 * @return The matrix raised to the power of n.
 * @throws std::invalid_argument If n is negative.
 * @throws std::invalid_argument If matrix is not a valid 2D vector of integers.
 */
std::vector<std::vector<int>> power(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix, int n) {
    if (n < 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Exponent must be non-negative.");
    }
    // Add your implementation logic here for matrix exponentiation
    // ...

    // Placeholder return value
    return matrix;
}
```

In this C++ version:
- The function signature uses `std::vector<std::vector<int>>` to represent a 2D array of integers.
- The docstring is converted into a multi-line comment block that describes the function, parameters, return value, and possible exceptions.
- Exception handling is used with `std::invalid_argument` to handle invalid input conditions.
- The implementation logic for matrix exponentiation needs to be added within the function body.
