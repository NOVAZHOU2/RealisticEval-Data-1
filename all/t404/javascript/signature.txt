Here's how you can write that Python function in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Computes the n-th power of a matrix using the fast exponentiation method.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A square matrix to be exponentiated.
 * @param {number} n - The exponent to raise the matrix to. Must be a non-negative integer.
 * @returns {Array<Array<number>>} - The matrix raised to the power of n.
 * @throws {Error} If n is negative or if matrix is not a 2D array.
 */
function power(matrix, n) {
```

Please note that JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for type checking like Python does with `typing`. So, we use JSDoc style comments instead to describe types and potential errors. Also, error handling in JavaScript typically uses exceptions (`throw` and `try...catch`) rather than raising exceptions directly.
