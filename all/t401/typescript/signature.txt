Sure! Here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
import { match } from 'assert';

/**
 * Find and return a list of all placeholders in the format {{ placeholder }} from the input text.
 *
 * @param text - The input string containing potential placeholders.
 * @returns An array of matching placeholders.
 */
function findPlaceholders(text: string): string[] {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've added type annotations for the function parameters and return value. Note that TypeScript uses `string[]` to represent an array of strings, which is equivalent to Python's `list`. Also, TypeScript doesn't have a direct equivalent for Python's `re.match`, so you might need to adjust the implementation accordingly.
