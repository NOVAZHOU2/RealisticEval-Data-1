/**
 * Parses a JSON file and stores its contents in a Map.
 *
 * @param filePath the path to the JSON file to be parsed. The file must exist and contain valid JSON.
 *                 The path should be a fully qualified path or relative to the current working directory.
 * @return a Map<String, Object> containing the key-value pairs parsed from the JSON file. If the JSON
 *         file is empty or contains only simple key-value pairs without nested structures, the resulting
 *         Map will be correspondingly simple. The function returns an empty Map if the file is empty.
 * @throws FileNotFoundException if the specified file does not exist or cannot be opened. This exception
 *         is caught within the function and logged to the standard output, but it might be more appropriate
 *         in a real-world application to rethrow it or handle it in a way that informs the user more effectively.
