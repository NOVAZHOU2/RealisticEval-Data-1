Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Parses a JSON file and stores its contents in an object.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The path to the JSON file to be parsed. 
 *                            The file must exist and contain valid JSON.
 *                            The path should be a fully qualified path or relative to the current working directory.
 * @returns {Object} - An object containing the key-value pairs parsed from the JSON file.
 */
function parseJsonFile(filePath) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The Python type hints were removed, as JavaScript does not have built-in type annotations.
- The comment block was converted to JSDoc format for better documentation in JavaScript.
