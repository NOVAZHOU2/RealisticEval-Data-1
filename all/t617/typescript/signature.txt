Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function signature, along with the documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Parses a JSON file and stores its contents in a dictionary.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the JSON file to be parsed. The file must exist and contain valid JSON.
 *                   The path should be a fully qualified path or relative to the current working directory.
 * @returns A dictionary containing the key-value pairs parsed from the JSON file.
 */
function parseJsonFile(filePath: string): Record<string, any> {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've used `Record<string, any>` to represent the dictionary type, reflecting the original Python structure. The comments have been converted to JSDoc format for clarity.
