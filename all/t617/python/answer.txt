Here's how you can convert the provided Java class into Python code. The Java code reads a JSON file, parses its contents, and stores them in a dictionary (equivalent to a Map in Java).
Below is the equivalent Python code using the built-in json module and handling file operations similarly to the Java version.
python
import json
from typing import Dict, Any

class Answer:
    """
    A class to handle JSON file parsing and storage of key-value pairs.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def parse_json_file(file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Parses a JSON file and stores its contents in a dictionary.

        This function reads a JSON file from the specified file path, parses the JSON data, and stores
        each key-value pair from the JSON object into a dictionary.

        Args:
            file_path (str): The path to the JSON file to be parsed. The file must exist and contain valid JSON.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the key-value pairs parsed from the JSON file.
                             The function returns an empty dictionary if the file is empty.
        """
        result_dict = {}
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                result_dict = json.load(file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print(f"Error decoding JSON from the file: {file_path}")

        return result_dict

    @staticmethod
    def main():
        file_path = "path_to_your_json_file.json"  # Update this to your JSON file path
        data = Answer.parse_json_file(file_path)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Answer.main()
Explanation of the Code
Imports:
The json module is imported to handle JSON data.
Dict and Any from the typing module are imported for type annotations.
Class Definition:
A class Answer is created, similar to the Java class.
Static Method parse_json_file:
Takes a string file_path as an argument and returns a dictionary.
Opens the specified file and loads its content using json.load().
Catches FileNotFoundError to handle cases where the file does not exist.
Also catches json.JSONDecodeError to handle invalid JSON formats.
Main Method:
A static method main() is defined to demonstrate how to use the parse_json_file method.
It sets the file path and prints the resulting dictionary.
Execution Check:
The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to execute the main() method when the script is run directly.
Example Usage
To use this code, simply replace "path_to_your_json_file.json" with the actual path of your JSON file. When executed, it will print the contents of the JSON file as a dictionary.
