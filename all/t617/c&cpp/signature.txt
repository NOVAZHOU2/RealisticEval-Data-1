Here's the equivalent C++ code for the provided Python function signature and documentation:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

/* 
 * Parses a JSON file and stores its contents in a dictionary.
 * 
 * Args:
 *     file_path (std::string): The path to the JSON file to be parsed. The file must exist and contain valid JSON.
 *                               The path should be a fully qualified path or relative to the current working directory.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *     std::unordered_map<std::string, Any>: A dictionary containing the key-value pairs parsed from the JSON file.
 */
std::unordered_map<std::string, Any> parse_json_file(const std::string& file_path);
```

Note: In C++, `Any` should be defined or replaced with a suitable type depending on the JSON library you plan to use.
