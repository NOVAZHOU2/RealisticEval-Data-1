To convert the provided JavaScript user script into Python code, we need to take into account the environment in which the code would run. Since Python does not run directly in web browsers like JavaScript does, we would typically use a library such as BeautifulSoup to parse and manipulate HTML content.
Here's a Python script that performs a similar function to the JavaScript code, iterating over a list of HTML elements and removing those that match a certain class. This example assumes that you have a string containing HTML content and want to remove certain list items.
Python Code Using BeautifulSoup
python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Sample HTML content (as a string)
html_content = """
<ul>
    <li>Ad 1 <span class="css-16lshh0">Sponsored</span></li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Ad 2 <span class="css-16lshh0">Sponsored</span></li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
"""

def remove_ads(html):
    # Parse the HTML content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    
    # Find all 'li' elements
    list_items = soup.find_all('li')
    
    # Iterate over list items and remove sponsored ads
    for item in list_items:
        is_sponsored = item.find(class_='css-16lshh0')
        if is_sponsored:
            item.decompose()  # Remove the item from the tree
    
    # Return the modified HTML
    return str(soup)

# Remove ads from the sample HTML content
modified_html = remove_ads(html_content)
print(modified_html)
Explanation:
Imports:
We import BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library, which is used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
HTML Content:
The html_content variable contains a sample HTML string that represents a list with items, some of which are ads.
Function remove_ads:
This function takes an HTML string as input.
It parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
It finds all li elements on the page.
For each list item, it checks for the presence of a child element with the class name css-16lshh0.
If such an element is found, it removes the entire li element from the document using the decompose() method.
Return Value:
The modified HTML (with ads removed) is returned as a string.
Usage:
The function is called with html_content, and the result is printed.
Requirements:
To run this code, ensure you have the BeautifulSoup library installed. You can install it using pip:
bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
Note:
This code works in a backend or script environment, unlike the original JavaScript that runs in the browser. If you're working with a live web page or need to interact with a browser, you would typically use a library like Selenium or requests-html to fetch and manipulate HTML content dynamically.
