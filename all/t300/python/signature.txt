To convert the JavaScript function signature and its comment to Python, you can follow the Python conventions for function documentation and signature. In Python, we typically use a docstring to describe the function. Hereâ€™s how you can represent the JavaScript function signature in Python:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
function removeAds() {}
Python Equivalent
python
def remove_ads():
    """
    Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for function implementation
Explanation:
Function Definition:
In Python, the def keyword is used to define a function. Here, it's named remove_ads, following Python's convention of using lowercase letters and underscores for function names.
Docstring:
A triple-quoted string is used right after the function definition to describe what the function does. This serves as documentation for the function.
Placeholder:
The pass statement is a placeholder indicating that the function currently does nothing. This can be replaced with the actual implementation later.
This Python code captures the essence of the original JavaScript signature and documentation.
