Certainly! Below is the Python code signature with similar comments:

```python
"""
Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
"""

def remove_ads():
    pass
```

This Python function `remove_ads` serves the same purpose as the JavaScript function `removeAds`, which iterates over list items on a web page and removes ads containing a specific class name. The `pass` statement indicates that the function body is currently empty but can be filled in later.
