Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
public void removeAds() {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In Java, methods are part of classes, so you would typically define them within a class. If you need to use this method in a specific context, make sure it's placed inside an appropriate class. For example:

```java
public class WebPageProcessor {
    /**
     * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
     */
    public void removeAds() {
        // Your implementation here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebPageProcessor processor = new WebPageProcessor();
        processor.removeAds();
    }
}
```

This way, `removeAds` is part of the `WebPageProcessor` class, and you can call it from the `main` method for testing purposes.
