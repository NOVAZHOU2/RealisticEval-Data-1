Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments retained, adapted for a method in a Java class:

```java
/**
 * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
public void removeAds(WebDriver driver) {

}
```

This signature assumes you are passing a `WebDriver` instance to interact with the web page.
