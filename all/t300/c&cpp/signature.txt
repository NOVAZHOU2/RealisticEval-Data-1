Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the provided JavaScript function, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
/**
 * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
void removeAds();
```

This C++ function signature indicates that `removeAds` is a function that does not take any parameters and does not return any value (it returns `void`). The comments remain the same to describe the purpose of the function.
