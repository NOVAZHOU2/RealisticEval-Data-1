Certainly! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature that mirrors the JavaScript structure while keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
/**
 * Iterate over list items and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
void removeAds() {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

You can place your implementation inside the `removeAds` function. If you need any more adjustments or details, just let me know!
