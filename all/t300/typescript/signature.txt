Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Iterate over list items on a web page and remove ads that contain a specific class name
 */
function removeAds(): void {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In TypeScript, I've added the `: void` return type to indicate that the function does not return any value. If you expect the function to return something, you can adjust the return type accordingly.
