Here's how you can convert your JavaScript function to Python:

```python
def is_background_too_dark_or_bright():
    pass  # Replace 'pass' with your logic here
```

In Python, we don't have types like `string` for return values or parameters, so there's no need to specify them in the function signature. The `pass` keyword is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. 

Please replace the `pass` keyword with your actual logic.
