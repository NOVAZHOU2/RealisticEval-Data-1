To convert the JavaScript function signature and its documentation comment into a Python function signature with similar documentation, you can use a docstring. Hereâ€™s how it would look in Python:
Python Code Signature
python
def is_background_too_dark_or_bright() -> str:
    """Detect the light or dark state of the background element of a major element
    of a web page and return the corresponding description string.

    Returns:
        str: "dark" if the background is too dark, 
             "bright" if it is too bright, 
             or "normal" if it is neither.
    """
    pass  # Replace with actual implementation
Explanation:
Function Name:
The function is named is_background_too_dark_or_bright, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Return Type Hint:
The return type is indicated as -> str, specifying that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
The docstring provides a detailed description of what the function does, similar to the JavaScript comments. It explains the function's purpose and the possible return values.
Implementation Placeholder:
pass is used as a placeholder for the actual implementation, indicating that the function currently does nothing but is defined.
You can now fill in the function body with the necessary logic to detect the light or dark state of the background element.
