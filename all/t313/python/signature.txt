Sure, here's how you can convert that JavaScript function signature to a Python function signature while keeping the comments:

```python
"""
Detecting the light or dark state of the background element of a major element of a web page and returning the corresponding description string

:return: Returns "dark" if the background is too dark, "bright" if it is too bright, or "normal" if it is neither.
:rtype: str
"""

def is_background_too_dark_or_bright():
    pass
```

In this Python version:
- The docstring (doc comment) follows the same structure as the JavaScript one.
- The `@returns` tag in JavaScript is replaced with `:return:` in Python for specifying the return type.
- The `@type` tag in JavaScript is replaced with `:rtype:` in Python for specifying the return type.
- The function name remains the same (`isBackgroundTooDarkOrBright` in JavaScript becomes `is_background_too_dark_or_bright` in Python).
