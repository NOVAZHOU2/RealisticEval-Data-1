Here's how you can change the JavaScript code signature to C++ while keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
/**
 * Detecting the light or dark state of the background element of a major element of a web page and returning the corresponding description string
 *
 * @returns std::string - Returns "dark" if the background is too dark, "bright" if it is too bright, or "normal" if it is neither.
 */
std::string isBackgroundTooDarkOrBright() {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

In this C++ version, I've used `std::string` to match the JavaScript return type, and the comments remain the same. You can implement the function logic as needed.
