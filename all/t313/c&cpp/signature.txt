Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Detecting the light or dark state of the background element of a major element of a web page and returning the corresponding description string
 *
 * @return std::string - Returns "dark" if the background is too dark, "bright" if it is too bright, or "normal" if it is neither.
 */
std::string isBackgroundTooDarkOrBright();
```

This C++ function signature matches the JavaScript function in terms of its return type and documentation comment.
