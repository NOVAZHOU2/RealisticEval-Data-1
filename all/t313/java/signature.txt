Sure! Here's how you can convert the JavaScript function signature to a Java method signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Detecting the light or dark state of the background element of a major element of a web page and returning the corresponding description string
 *
 * @return String - Returns "dark" if the background is too dark, "bright" if it is too bright, or "normal" if it is neither.
 */
public String isBackgroundTooDarkOrBright() {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, the `@return` tag is used to describe the return type and value of the method. The method name should follow Java naming conventions (camelCase).
