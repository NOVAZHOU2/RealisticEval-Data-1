Hereâ€™s how you can translate the JavaScript function signature and comments into Java. The Java version will include the appropriate method signature and retain the comments:

```java
/**
 * Detecting the light or dark state of the background color and returning the corresponding description string.
 *
 * @param backgroundColor The Color of the background to evaluate.
 * @return "dark" if the background is too dark, "bright" if it is too bright, or "normal" if it is neither.
 */
public String isBackgroundTooDarkOrBright(Color backgroundColor) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In this version, I've added a `Color` parameter to the method to allow for passing the background color, which is necessary for the evaluation in Java. Would you like help with anything else?
