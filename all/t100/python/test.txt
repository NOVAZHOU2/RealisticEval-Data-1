To convert the given JavaScript Jest test cases to Python unittest format, you'll need to create a test class that contains test methods for each case. Below is the equivalent Python code using the unittest framework:
Converted Python Test Code
python
import unittest

# Assuming the convert_time function is defined in a module named 'duration_converter'.
# If it's in the same file, you can import it directly.
from duration_converter import convert_time  

class TestConvertTimeFunction(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_full_iso_duration(self):
        """Test converting full ISO 8601 duration with hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds."""
        self.assertEqual(convert_time('PT1H23M45.678S'), '1h23m45s678ms')

    def test_duration_with_seconds_and_milliseconds(self):
        """Test converting duration with only seconds and milliseconds."""
        self.assertEqual(convert_time('PT45.5S'), '45s500ms')

    def test_duration_with_hours_and_minutes_no_seconds(self):
        """Test converting duration with hours and minutes, but no seconds."""
        self.assertEqual(convert_time('PT2H5M'), '2h5m')

    def test_duration_with_only_seconds_no_milliseconds(self):
        """Test converting duration with only seconds, no milliseconds."""
        self.assertEqual(convert_time('PT20S'), '20s')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Python Test Code
Imports:
Import the unittest module to use its testing framework.
Import the convert_time function from the appropriate module (replace duration_converter with the actual name of your module).
Test Class:
Create a class TestConvertTimeFunction that inherits from unittest.TestCase. This class will contain all your test methods.
Test Methods:
Each test case is defined as a method in the class, starting with test_ to ensure that unittest recognizes it as a test.
Use self.assertEqual() to check if the output of the convert_time function matches the expected output.
Docstrings:
Each test method has a docstring that describes what the test is checking, similar to the comments in the original Jest tests.
Main Block:
The if __name__ == '__main__': block is used to run the tests when the script is executed directly.
Running the Tests
To run the tests, you would typically execute the Python file from the command line:
bash
python test_duration_converter.py
Replace test_duration_converter.py with the name of your Python test file. If all tests pass, youâ€™ll see an output indicating success; otherwise, you'll see details of any failures or errors.
