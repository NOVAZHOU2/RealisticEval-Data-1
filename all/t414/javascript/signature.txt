Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the title, author, and year from a BibTeX file content such as 
 * @article{sample2024,
 *   author = {John Doe and Jane Smith},
 *   title = {A Comprehensive Study on AI},
 *   year = {2024}
 * }
 *
 * @param {string} bibFile - The path to the BibTeX file.
 * 
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - An array containing objects with title, author, and year for each article.
 */
function extractBibInfo(bibFile) {
    // Function body remains the same as per your logic in Python
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function's logic isn't included here, only the signature and comments have been translated.
