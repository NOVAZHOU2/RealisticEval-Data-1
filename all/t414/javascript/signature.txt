Certainly! Below is the JavaScript code signature equivalent to your Python function, keeping the same structure and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the title, author, and year from a BibTeX file.
 *
 * @param {string} bibFile - The path to the BibTeX file.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - A list containing dictionaries with title, author, and year for each article.
 */
function extractBibInfo(bibFile) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

This JavaScript function signature mirrors the Python one, including the parameter name and type, as well as the return type and description in JSDoc format.
