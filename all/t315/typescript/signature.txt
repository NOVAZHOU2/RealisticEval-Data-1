Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Extract the fileid from the given URL query args. If not found return null.
 * For example:
 *      input: https://example.com/download?fileId=12345
 *      output: 12345
 *
 * @param {string} url - The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.
 * @returns {string | null} - The extracted file ID if present, otherwise null if the URL does not conform to the expected format.
 */
function getFileIdFromUrl(url: string): string | null {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've added type annotations for the `url` parameter and the return value. This helps ensure that the function is used correctly and can catch type-related errors at compile time.
