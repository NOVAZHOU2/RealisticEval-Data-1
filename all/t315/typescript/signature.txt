Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature with the comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Extract the file ID from the given URL query args. If not found, return null.
 * For example:
 *      input: https://example.com/download?fileId=12345
 *      output: 12345
 *
 * @param {string} url - The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.
 * @returns {string | null} - The extracted file ID if present, otherwise null if the URL does not conform to the expected format.
 */
function getFileIdFromUrl(url: string): string | null {
}
```
