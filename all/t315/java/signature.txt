Here's the Java code signature with comments, adapted from your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * Extract the file ID from the given URL query args. If not found, return null.
 * For example:
 *      input: https://example.com/download?fileId=12345
 *      output: 12345
 *
 * @param url - The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.
 * @return - The extracted file ID if present, otherwise null if the URL does not conform to the expected format.
 */
public static String getFileIdFromUrl(String url) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments while changing the syntax to Java.
