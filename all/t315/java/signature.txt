Here's how you can translate the JavaScript function signature into Java, keeping the same comments and structure:

```java
/**
 * Extracts the file id from the given URL query parameters. If not found, returns null.
 * For example:
 *      Input: https://example.com/download?fileId=12345
 *      Output: 12345
 *
 * @param url The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.
 * @return The extracted file ID if present, otherwise null if the URL does not conform to the expected format.
 */
public static String getFileIdFromUrl(String url) {
}
```

This Java method signature follows the same logic and documentation style as your original JavaScript function.
