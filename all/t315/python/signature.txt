Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function signature and documentation into a Python function signature and docstring:
Python Code Signature
python
def get_file_id_from_url(url: str) -> str:
    """Extract the file ID from the given URL query args.

    If not found, return None.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.

    Returns:
        str: The extracted file ID if present, otherwise None if the URL does not conform to the expected format.

    Example:
        Input: "https://example.com/download?fileId=12345"
        Output: "12345"
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Definition:
def get_file_id_from_url(url: str) -> str: specifies the function name and parameters.
url: str indicates that the parameter url is expected to be a string.
-> str specifies that the function is expected to return a string.
Docstring:
The docstring provides a detailed explanation of what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
The example usage is formatted to show how the function can be called with an input URL.
Placeholder for Implementation:
The pass statement serves as a placeholder for the actual implementation of the function, which you can fill in as needed.
This signature and docstring adhere to Python conventions and provide clear documentation similar to the original JavaScript version.
