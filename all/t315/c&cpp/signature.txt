```cpp
/**
 * Extract the fileid from the given URL query args. If not found return nullptr
 * For example:
 *      input: https://example.com/download?fileId=12345
 *      output: "12345"
 *
 * @param const std::string& url - The URL from which the file ID is to be extracted.
 * @return const char* - The extracted file ID if present, otherwise nullptr if the URL does not conform to the expected format.
 */
const char* getFileIdFromUrl(const std::string& url) {
}
```

Please note that in C++, we don't use `null` for pointers; instead, we use `nullptr`. Also, since C++ doesn't have a built-in string type like JavaScript's `String`, we typically use `std::string` or `char*` (character pointer). Here, I've used `const std::string&` as the parameter and returned `const char*`.
