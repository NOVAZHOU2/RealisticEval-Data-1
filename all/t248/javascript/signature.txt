Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code signature with comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Remove the corresponding sensitive question in the given dictionary based on the given key_to_remove array.
 *
 * @param {Object} data - The original question object.
 * @param {Array} [keyToRemove] - Array of keys to remove.
 * @returns {Object} - The sanitized object with the specified keys removed.
 */
```

This JavaScript function signature uses JSDoc comments to document the parameters and return type, similar to how Python's `typing` module works for static type hints.
