Here's the JavaScript version of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Removes the common leading indentation from each line in a given multi-line string,
 * preserving the relative indentation of the text.
 *
 * @param {string} multilineText - The input string containing multiple lines.
 * @returns {string} - The sanitized string with common leading indentation removed.
 */
function removeCommonIndentation(multilineText) {
    // ...
}
```

In JavaScript, we don't have type annotations like in Python, so we use JSDoc-style comments instead. The `@param` tag is used to describe the parameters and their types, while the `@returns` tag describes the return value and its type.
