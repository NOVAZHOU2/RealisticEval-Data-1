Certainly! Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, including appropriate Javadoc comments and Java conventions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * A utility class for removing common leading indentation from multi-line strings.
 */
public class Answer {

    /**
     * Removes the common leading indentation from each line in a given multi-line string,
     * preserving the relative indentation of the text.
     *
     * @param multilineText The input string containing multiple lines.
     * @return The sanitized string with common leading indentation removed.
     */
    public static String removeCommonIndentation(String multilineText) {
        String[] lines = multilineText.split("\n");

        // Filter out lines that are empty or only whitespace, as they do not affect minimum indentation
        int minIndent = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (String line : lines) {
            String trimmedLine = line.trim();
            if (!trimmedLine.isEmpty()) {
                int indent = line.length() - trimmedLine.length();
                minIndent = Math.min(minIndent, indent);
            }
        }

        // If there's no indentation or all lines are empty, return the original string
        if (minIndent == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            return multilineText;
        }

        // Remove the common leading indentation from each line
        StringBuilder sanitizedLines = new StringBuilder();
        for (String line : lines) {
            if (sanitizedLines.length() > 0) {
                sanitizedLines.append("\n");
            }
            sanitizedLines.append(line.substring(minIndent));
        }

        return sanitizedLines.toString();
    }

    /**
     * Main method for testing the functionality.
     *
     * @param args Command line arguments (not used).
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        String multilineText = "    This is a test.\n" +
                               "      This is another line.\n" +
                               "    And this is the last line.";
        System.out.println(removeCommonIndentation(multilineText));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The package declaration `package org.real.temp;` is included at the top.
2. **Class Definition**: The class `Answer` is defined with the appropriate access modifier (`public`).
3. **Javadoc Comments**: The Javadoc comments are added to provide detailed documentation for the method and the class.
4. **Method Signature**: The method `removeCommonIndentation` is defined with the appropriate signature and return type.
5. **Type Annotations**: The Python type annotations are translated into Java types (`String`).
6. **Logic Preservation**: The logic for removing common leading indentation is preserved, including filtering empty lines and calculating the minimum indentation.
7. **StringBuilder Usage**: A `StringBuilder` is used to efficiently construct the sanitized string.
8. **Main Method**: An example usage is provided in the `main` method to demonstrate how the method can be called.

This Java code maintains the original functionality and structure of the Python code while adhering to Java conventions and best practices.
