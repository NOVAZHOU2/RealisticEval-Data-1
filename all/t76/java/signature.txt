Sure, here is the Java version of your Python code signature, keeping the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Removes the common leading indentation from each line in a given multi-line string,
 * preserving the relative indentation of the text.
 *
 * @param multilineText The input string containing multiple lines.
 * @return The sanitized string with common leading indentation removed.
 */
public String removeCommonIndentation(String multilineText);
```

This method signature is for a Java method that takes a single `String` parameter and returns a `String`. The Javadoc comment describes what the method does, its parameters, and its return value, just like the Python docstring you provided.
