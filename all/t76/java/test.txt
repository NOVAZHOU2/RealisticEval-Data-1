To convert the provided Python unittest test class into a Java JUnit test case, you'll need to create a new Java class and write equivalent test methods using JUnit annotations and assertions. Below is an example of how you might do that:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class Tester {

    @Test
    public void testRemoveCommonIndentation() {
        String input = "    This is line 1\n" +
                       "    This is line 2\n" +
                       "    This is line 3";
        String expectedOutput = "This is line 1\n" +
                               "This is line 2\n" +
                               "This is line 3";

        String result = removeCommonIndentation(input);
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, result, "The common indentation should be removed");
    }

    // Implement the removeCommonIndentation method here
    private String removeCommonIndentation(String multilineText) {
        // Your implementation goes here
        return "";
    }
}
```

In this Java version:

- We've created a class named `Tester` in the package `org.real.temp`.
- We've used the `@Test` annotation to mark the `testRemoveCommonIndentation` method as a test method.
- We're using JUnit's `assertEquals` method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `removeCommonIndentation` method.
- The `removeCommonIndentation` method is left empty for you to implement.

Make sure to include the JUnit library in your project dependencies if you haven't already. If you're using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.8.1'
}
```

This setup will allow you to run your tests using a JUnit runner or via your build tool.
