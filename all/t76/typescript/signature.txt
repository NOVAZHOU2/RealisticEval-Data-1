Sure! Here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Removes the common leading indentation from each line in a given multi-line string,
 * preserving the relative indentation of the text.
 *
 * @param multilineText - The input string containing multiple lines.
 * @returns The sanitized string with common leading indentation removed.
 */
function removeCommonIndentation(multilineText: string): string {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function signature maintains the structure and comments from your original Python function.
