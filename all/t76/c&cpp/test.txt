Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ test case using Catch2 for the provided Python unittest function `remove_common_indentation`. Note that I'll assume you have the implementation of `remove_common_indentation` in C++. If not, you would need to provide it or mock it out for testing purposes.

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch.hpp"

// Assuming you have the implementation of remove_common_indentation here
std::string remove_common_indentation(const std::string& multiline_text);

TEST_CASE("remove_common_indentation", "[remove_common_indentation]") {
    SECTION("Single line without indentation") {
        REQUIRE(remove_common_indentation("Hello World") == "Hello World");
    }

    SECTION("Multiple lines with consistent indentation") {
        REQUIRE(remove_common_indentation(
            "    Line 1\n"
            "    Line 2\n"
            "    Line 3"
        ) == "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3");
    }

    SECTION("Mixed tabs and spaces") {
        REQUIRE(remove_common_indentation(
            "\t\tTabbed Line 1\n"
            "    Spaced Line 2\n"
            "\t\tTabbed Line 3"
        ) == "Tabbed Line 1\nSpaced Line 2\nTabbed Line 3");
    }

    SECTION("No common indentation") {
        REQUIRE(remove_common_indentation(
            "Line 1\n"
            "    Line 2\n"
            "Line 3"
        ) == "Line 1\n    Line 2\nLine 3");
    }

    SECTION("Leading spaces on some lines") {
        REQUIRE(remove_common_indentation(
            "    Line 1\n"
            "Line 2\n"
            "    Line 3"
        ) == "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3");
    }
}
```

In this C++ code:
- `#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` tells Catch2 to provide a `main()` function.
- `#include "catch.hpp"` includes the Catch2 header file.
- `remove_common_indentation` is assumed to be implemented somewhere in your project. If not, you should provide its implementation or mock it out.
- `TEST_CASE` defines a test case named "remove_common_indentation".
- `SECTION` defines individual sections within the test case, each representing a different scenario or test case.
- `REQUIRE` is used to assert that the output of `remove_common_indentation` matches the expected result.

Make sure you have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your build system to compile and run these tests.
