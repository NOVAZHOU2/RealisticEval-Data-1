Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Removes the common leading indentation from each line in a given multi-line string,
 * preserving the relative indentation of the text.
 *
 * @param multilineText The input string containing multiple lines.
 * @return std::string The sanitized string with common leading indentation removed.
 */
std::string removeCommonIndentation(const std::string& multilineText);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same purpose and structure as your original Python function signature, including the docstring that explains its functionality and parameters.
