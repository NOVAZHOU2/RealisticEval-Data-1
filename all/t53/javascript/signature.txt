Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Computes and returns the size of an object in bytes in memory.
 *
 * @param {any} obj - The question object.
 * @returns {number} - The size of this object in bytes in memory.
 */
```

Note that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in way to get the exact memory size of an object like Python does with `sys.getsizeof()`. This is because JavaScript operates on a garbage-collected heap, and determining the exact memory usage of objects can be complex and unreliable.
