Converting Python's `sys.getsizeof()` function to C or C++ is not straightforward because these languages do not have built-in support for querying the size of objects like Python does. However, you can use platform-specific methods to get the size of a pointer or a block of memory.

Here’s how you might write a simple example in C to measure the size of a pointer:

### C Code Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    
    // Print the size of the pointer
    printf("Size of pointer: %zu\n", sizeof(ptr));

    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- `sizeof(ptr)` gives the size of the pointer itself, not the size of what it points to.
- The `malloc` function allocates memory for an integer and assigns its address to `ptr`.
- `printf` prints the size of the pointer using `%zu`, which is used for printing `size_t`.

If you want to measure the actual size of the data pointed to by the pointer, you would need to know the size of that specific type. For example, if you want to measure the size of an integer, you would use:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    int* ptr = &num;

    // Print the size of the integer
    printf("Size of integer: %zu\n", sizeof(num));

    // Print the size of the pointer
    printf("Size of pointer: %zu\n", sizeof(ptr));

    return 0;
}
```

### C++ Code Example
In C++, you can achieve similar functionality using the `sizeof` operator directly on variables. Here’s a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    int* ptr = &num;

    // Print the size of the integer
    std::cout << "Size of integer: " << sizeof(num) << std::endl;

    // Print the size of the pointer
    std::cout << "Size of pointer: " << sizeof(ptr) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- `sizeof(num)` gives the size of the integer variable `num`.
- `sizeof(ptr)` gives the size of the pointer itself.

These examples demonstrate how to measure the sizes of basic types and pointers in both C and C++. If you need to measure the size of more complex structures or objects, you will need to manually calculate the sizes based on their composition.
