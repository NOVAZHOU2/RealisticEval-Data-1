Sure! Below is the C++ code signature for the given Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```cpp
/**
 * Computes and returns the size of an object in bytes in memory.
 *
 * @param obj The object whose size is to be computed.
 * @return The size of the object in bytes in memory.
 */
int size_in_bytes(const void* obj);
```

This C++ function signature uses `const void*` to represent any type of object, similar to Python's dynamic typing. The return type is `int`, which represents the size in bytes.
