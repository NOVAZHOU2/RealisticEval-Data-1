Sure! Here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Computes and returns the size of an object in bytes in memory.
 *
 * @param {any} obj - The object whose size in memory needs to be computed.
 * @returns {number} The size of this object in bytes in memory.
 */
function sizeInBytes(obj: any): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function signature maintains the structure and comments from your original Python code.
