Sure! Below is the Java code signature equivalent to the provided Python function signature, keeping the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Computes and returns the size of an object in bytes in memory.
 *
 * @param obj the question object
 * @return the size of this object in bytes in memory
 */
public int sizeInBytes(Object obj) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

This Java method `sizeInBytes` takes an `Object` as a parameter and returns an `int`, which represents the size of the object in bytes in memory. The Javadoc comment above the method provides a description of what the method does, its parameters, and its return value.
