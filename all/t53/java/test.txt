Sure! Below is the equivalent Java JUnit test case for the provided Python unittest test class `Tester`. Note that I'll assume you have some methods or properties that need to be tested within the `size_in_bytes` method.

```java
package org.real.temp;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Tester {

    @Test
    public void testSizeInBytes() {
        // Assuming we have some objects to test
        Object obj1 = new Object();
        Object obj2 = "Hello, World!";
        
        // Call the method with the objects and compare the results
        assertEquals(40, sizeInBytes(obj1)); // Size of an Object instance can vary based on JVM implementation
        assertEquals(25, sizeInBytes(obj2)); // Size of a String instance can vary based on JVM implementation
    }

    /**
     * Computes and returns the size of an object in bytes in memory.
     *
     * @param obj the object whose size is to be computed
     * @return the size of this object in bytes in memory
     */
    private int sizeInBytes(Object obj) {
        // This is a placeholder for actual logic to compute the size of an object in bytes
        // In practice, you might use reflection or other mechanisms to estimate the size
        return 0; // Replace with actual implementation
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package Declaration**: The package declaration at the top specifies where the class belongs.
2. **Class Declaration**: The class `Tester` is declared with the `@Test` annotation to indicate it contains test cases.
3. **Test Method**: The `testSizeInBytes` method is annotated with `@Test` and contains assertions to check the behavior of the `sizeInBytes` method.
4. **sizeInBytes Method**: This method is a placeholder for the actual logic to compute the size of an object in bytes. You will need to implement the actual logic based on your requirements.

### Notes:
- The sizes returned in the `assertEquals` calls are placeholders. In a real-world scenario, you would need to calculate the actual size of the objects using appropriate techniques such as reflection or profiling tools.
- The size of objects in Java can vary based on the JVM implementation, so the values used in the `assertEquals` calls are estimates and may not match exactly across different environments.

Make sure to replace the placeholder logic in the `sizeInBytes` method with the actual implementation that fits your needs.
