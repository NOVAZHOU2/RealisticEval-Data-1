Here's the equivalent TypeScript version of your C++ function:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Sorts the array of strings in the format "name + number" in ascending order. 
 * If the numbers are the same, sorts by name in ascending order, and returns the sorted array.
 *
 * @param arr An array of strings to be sorted.
 * @return An array of strings sorted according to the rules described above.
 */
function sortNames(arr: string[]): string[] {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```
