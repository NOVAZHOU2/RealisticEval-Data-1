Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript version of the provided C++ function signature, adapted for JavaScript conventions while preserving the original functionality and structure:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Sorts the string array with the shape of "name + number" in ascending order. 
 * If the numbers are the same, sorts by name in ascending order, and returns the sorted array.
 *
 * @param {Array<string>} arr An array of strings to be sorted.
 * @return {Array<string>} A sorted array of strings according to the rules described above.
 */
function sortNames(arr) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: Changed from C++ `vector<string>` to JavaScript `Array<string>`.
2. **Comment Style**: Kept the comments in the same format but adjusted for JavaScript syntax.
3. **Memory Management**: No explicit memory management is needed in JavaScript, as it handles memory automatically.

Feel free to implement the sorting logic within the `sortNames` function!
