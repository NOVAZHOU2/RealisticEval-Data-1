Here's the C++ function signature converted to Python, with the comments converted to Python style and retained:
python
def sort_names(arr: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Sort the string array with the shape of "name + number" in ascending order. 
    If the numbers are the same, sort by name in ascending order, and return the sorted array.

    :param arr: A reference to the list of strings to be sorted.
    :return: A list of strings sorted according to the rules described above.
    """
Explanation:
Function Name: The function name sort_names is written in snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
Parameter: The parameter arr is annotated with List[str], indicating it is a list of strings.
Return Type: The return type is annotated with List[str], indicating that the function will return a list of strings.
Docstring: The comments are now in a Python docstring format, maintaining the original content but converting the style to fit Python conventions.
Make sure to include the necessary import at the top of your Python file:
python
from typing import List
This allows you to use List for type hints.
