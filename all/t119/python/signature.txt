To convert the JavaScript code signature to a Python code signature with appropriate docstring formatting, you can follow the conventions used in Python for function definitions and documentation. Hereâ€™s how you can represent the JavaScript function signature as a Python function signature, including a docstring that describes the function's purpose and its parameters.
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * gets the cookie value for the specified name from the cookie in the browser. 
 * The format of the cookie is key=value;key=value;key=value 
 * @param name cookie key name 
 */
function getCookie(name) {}
Python Code Signature
python
def get_cookie(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Gets the cookie value for the specified name from the cookie string.

    The format of the cookie is key=value; key=value; key=value.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the cookie key to retrieve.

    Returns:
        str: The value of the specified cookie if found; otherwise, None.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here
Explanation of the Python Code Signature
Function Definition:
The function is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name get_cookie.
The parameter name is typed as str to indicate it should be a string.
Return Type Annotation:
The return type is annotated with -> str to indicate that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
A docstring is included within triple quotes. It describes what the function does, the format of the cookies, the arguments, and the return value.
The Args: section specifies the parameter and its type.
The Returns: section specifies the return value and its type.
Placeholder Implementation:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder, indicating that the implementation of the function will be added later.
This Python signature follows best practices for documenting functions, making it clear and understandable for other developers who may work with the code in the future.
