Sure, here is the Python code with the same signature and comments:

```python
def count_letters(s):
    """
    Count the number of letters in a string.

    :param s: The input string from which to count letters.
    :type s: str
    :return: The count of letters in the string.
    :rtype: int
    """
    pass
```

This Python function `count_letters` takes a single parameter `s` of type `str`, and it returns an integer representing the count of letters in the string. The docstring includes a brief description of what the function does, the parameter details, and the return value details.
