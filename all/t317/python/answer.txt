Sure! Here is the equivalent Python function for your JavaScript code:

```python
def count_letters(s):
    """
    Count the number of letters in a string.

    :param s: The input string from which to count letters.
    :return: The count of letters in the string.
    """
    return sum(c.isalpha() for c in s)
```

This Python function `count_letters` takes a single parameter `s`, which is the input string. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is an alphabetic letter using the `isalpha()` method. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (which are treated as 1) to give the total count of letters in the string.
