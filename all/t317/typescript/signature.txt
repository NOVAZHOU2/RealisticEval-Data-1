Here's the TypeScript code signature with the comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Count the number of letters in a string.
 *
 * @param {string} str - The input string from which to count letters.
 * @returns {number} - The count of letters in the string.
 */
function countLetters(str: string): number {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

In this signature, `str: string` indicates that `str` must be a string, and `: number` indicates that the function returns a number. The comments remain unchanged.
