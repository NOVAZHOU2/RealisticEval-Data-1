Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Count the number of letters in a string.
 *
 * @param str - The input string from which to count letters.
 * @return - The count of letters in the string.
 */
public static int countLetters(String str) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The function keyword is replaced with `public static int`, indicating that the method returns an integer.
- The `@returns` tag is changed to `@return` to match JavaDoc conventions.
