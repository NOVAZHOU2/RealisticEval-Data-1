Sure! Hereâ€™s how you can convert the JavaScript code signature, including the comments, to C++:

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of letters in a string.
 *
 * @param str - The input string from which to count letters.
 * @returns The count of letters in the string.
 */
int countLetters(const std::string& str);
```

### Explanation:
- The function signature in C++ defines `countLetters` as a function that takes a constant reference to a `std::string` and returns an `int`.
- The comments are preserved to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
