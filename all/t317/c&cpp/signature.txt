Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of letters in a string.
 *
 * @param str - The input string from which to count letters.
 * @return The count of letters in the string.
 */
int countLetters(const std::string& str);
```

This function takes a constant reference to a `std::string` and returns an `int`, representing the count of letters in the string.
