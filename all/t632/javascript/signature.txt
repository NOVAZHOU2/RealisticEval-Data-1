Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with comments formatted in JSDoc:

```javascript
/**
 * Parses a mathematical expression string into an array of tokens.
 * This function identifies both operands (numbers) and operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)
 * in the provided expression and returns them in an array format.
 *
 * @param {string} expression - The mathematical expression to be parsed.
 * @returns {string[]} An array containing the tokens identified in the expression.
 *                     The array will include both operands and operators in the order they appear.
 */
function parseExpression(expression) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function signature remains similar, with `expression` as a parameter.
- JSDoc comments are structured to include `@param` and `@returns` annotations for clarity.
