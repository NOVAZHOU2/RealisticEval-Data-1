Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python function that parses an expression into tokens:

```javascript
function parseExpression(expression) {
    const tokens = [];
    // Regular expression to match numbers (including decimals) and operators
    const regex = /\d+\.?\d*|[+*/()\-]/g;
    // Use regex to find matches in the expression
    let match;
    while ((match = regex.exec(expression)) !== null) {
        // Add each found token to the array
        tokens.push(match[0]);
    }
    return tokens;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `regex` is defined similarly to match numbers (including decimals) and operators.
- We use `regex.exec()` in a loop to find all matches, similar to `re.finditer()` in Python.
- Each match is pushed into the `tokens` array. 
- The function returns the `tokens` array at the end, maintaining the original functionality.
