Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java class, which parses a mathematical expression into tokens (numbers, operators, and parentheses):
Java Code
Here's a brief reminder of the Java code you provided for context:
java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Answer {
    public List<String> parseExpression(String expression) {
        List<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
        // Regular expression to match numbers (including decimals) and operators
        String regex = "\\d+\\.?\\d*|[+\\-*/()]";
        // Use regex to find matches in the expression
        java.util.regex.Pattern pattern = java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(regex);
        java.util.regex.Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(expression);
        while (matcher.find()) {
            // Add each found token to the list
            tokens.add(matcher.group());
        }
        return tokens;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Answer answer = new Answer();
        String expression = "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)";
        List<String> result = answer.parseExpression(expression);
        // Print the result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
Python Equivalent
Hereâ€™s the equivalent implementation in Python:
python
import re
from typing import List

class Answer:
    def parse_expression(self, expression: str) -> List[str]:
        tokens = []
        # Regular expression to match numbers (including decimals) and operators
        regex = r'\d+\.?\d*|[+*/()\-]'
        # Use regex to find matches in the expression
        matches = re.finditer(regex, expression)
        for match in matches:
            # Add each found token to the list
            tokens.append(match.group())
        return tokens

if __name__ == "__main__":
    answer = Answer()
    expression = "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)"
    result = answer.parse_expression(expression)
    # Print the result
    print(result)
Explanation of the Code
Imports:
re: Python's built-in library for regular expressions.
List: Type hinting for indicating the return type of the parse_expression method.
Class and Method Definition:
The Answer class is defined, containing the parse_expression method.
The method uses a regular expression to match numbers (including decimal numbers) and operators.
Regex:
The regex pattern r'\d+\.?\d*|[+*/()\-]' is used to match integers, decimals, and operators. The \- is included to match the subtraction operator.
Finding Matches:
re.finditer() is used to find all matches of the regex pattern in the given expression. This returns an iterator yielding match objects.
Appending Tokens:
Each matched token is added to the tokens list.
Main Execution Block:
An instance of Answer is created, and the parse_expression method is called with a sample expression. The result is printed.
This Python implementation closely mirrors the functionality of the original Java code while adhering to Python conventions.
