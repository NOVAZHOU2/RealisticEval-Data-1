To convert the Java function signature provided into a Python function signature, we will consider the following points:
Java List vs. Python List: In Java, List<String> is used, while in Python, we simply use list to denote a list of strings.
String Parameter: The String type in Java corresponds to the str type in Python.
Function Definition: Python does not require the return type to be specified explicitly in the function signature. Instead, it's implied that the function will return a value based on its implementation.
Here's how the Java function signature can be translated into a Python function signature:
Java Function Signature
java
public List<String> parseExpression(String expression) {}
Python Function Signature
python
def parse_expression(expression: str) -> list[str]:
Explanation:
Function Name: The name is changed to parse_expression, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter: The parameter is expression, typed as str.
Return Type: The return type is annotated as list[str], indicating a list of strings will be returned.
Complete Python Function Signature
Here is the complete Python function signature:
python
def parse_expression(expression: str) -> list[str]:
You can implement the function according to your requirements after this signature.
