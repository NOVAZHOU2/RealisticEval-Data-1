Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript version of the provided C++ function signature, including comments and adapting for JavaScript conventions:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Sorts a portion of an array using the merge sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - An array of integers that contains the
 *                         elements to be sorted.
 * @param {number} left - The starting index of the portion of the array to be
 *                       sorted.
 * @param {number} right - The ending index of the portion of the array to be
 *                        sorted.
 */
function mergeSort(arr, left, right) {}
```

This version preserves the functionality and structure while adapting to JavaScript syntax.
