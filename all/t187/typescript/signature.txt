Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of the provided C++ function signature, including the comments converted to TypeScript style:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Sorts a portion of an array using the merge sort algorithm.
 *
 * @param arr An array of integers that contains the elements to be sorted.
 * @param left The starting index of the portion of the array to be sorted.
 * @param right The ending index of the portion of the array to be sorted.
 */
function mergeSort(arr: number[], left: number, right: number): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this conversion:
- The C++ `std::vector<int>&` is replaced with `number[]` in TypeScript, reflecting an array of numbers.
- The C++ `void` return type remains `void` in TypeScript.
- Comments are formatted in TypeScript style while preserving their original meaning.
