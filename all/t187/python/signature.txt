To convert the provided C++ function signature to Python, we need to change the function declaration and adjust the comments to Python-style comments. Below is the converted code with comments retained and formatted appropriately:
python
def merge_sort(arr, left, right):
    """
    Sorts a portion of an array using the merge sort algorithm.

    Parameters:
    arr (list[int]): A list of integers that contains the elements to be sorted.
    left (int): The starting index of the portion of the array to be sorted.
    right (int): The ending index of the portion of the array to be sorted.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Declaration: Changed from C++ void merge_sort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) to Python's def merge_sort(arr, left, right):.
Comments: Converted C++ style comments (/** ... */) to Python's docstring format (""" ... """) for documentation.
Type Annotations: Adjusted the type specifications from C++ types to Python types (e.g., vector<int> to list[int]).
Function Body: Used pass as a placeholder for the function body, indicating that the implementation will be added later.
