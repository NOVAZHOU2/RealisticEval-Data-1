Sure, here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Convert an angle from radians to degrees.
 *
 * @param radians The angle in radians to convert.
 * @return The angle in degrees.
 */
public static int radiansToDegrees(double radians) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, the method should be defined within a class, and it's common to use `static` if you want to call the method without creating an instance of the class. Also, note that Java uses `double` instead of `float` for floating-point numbers, and the return type is `int`.
