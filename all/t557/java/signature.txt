Certainly! Here’s the equivalent Java code for the given Python function, including appropriate Javadoc comments and type conversions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * A class that provides methods for angle conversions.
 */
public class Answer {

    /**
     * Converts an angle from radians to degrees.
     *
     * @param radians The angle in radians to convert.
     * @return The angle in degrees as an integer.
     */
    public static int radiansToDegrees(double radians) {
        int degrees = (int) (radians * (180 / Math.PI));
        return degrees;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double radians = Math.PI / 4; // 45 degrees in radians
        int degrees = radiansToDegrees(radians);
        System.out.println("Radians: " + radians + ", Degrees: " + degrees);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Package Declaration**: `package org.real.temp;` declares the package where this class resides.
- **Class Definition**: `public class Answer` defines the class `Answer`.
- **Javadoc Comments**: The Javadoc comments provide detailed documentation for the method, including the parameters and return type.
- **Method Definition**: `public static int radiansToDegrees(double radians)` is a static method that takes a single parameter `radians` of type `double` and returns an `int` value representing the angle in degrees.
- **Math.PI**: In Java, `Math.PI` is used to represent the mathematical constant π.
- **Type Conversion**: The result is cast to an `int` using `(int)` to match the return type specified in the Python function.
- **Main Method**: An example `main` method is included to demonstrate how to call the `radiansToDegrees` method. This is optional and can be removed if you plan to use this method in another part of your application.

This Java code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python function while adhering to Java conventions and best practices.
