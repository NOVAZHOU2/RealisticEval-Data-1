Here is the equivalent Java code for your Python function:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {
    /**
     * Convert an angle from radians to degrees.
     *
     * @param radians The angle in radians to convert.
     * @return The angle in degrees.
     */
    public static int radiansToDegrees(double radians) {
        return (int) Math.toDegrees(radians);
    }
}
```

Please note that I've made the following changes:

1. Changed the package name to `org.real.temp` and the class name to `Answer`, as per your request.
2. Changed the method signature to `public static int radiansToDegrees(double radians)`. In Java, all methods must belong to a class, so we need to define it within the `Answer` class. We also use `static` because we don't need to create an instance of `Answer` to call this method. The return type is now `int` instead of `float`, since the conversion result will always be an integer value.
3. Used `Math.toDegrees(radians)` to perform the actual conversion, which is the equivalent of your Python code's `radians * 180 / math.pi`.
4. Converted the result to `int` using casting `(int)`, as per your original Python function's return type.
