Sure! Below is how you can translate your Python `unittest` test class into a C++ `Catch2` test case. I'll assume you have a function `radians_to_degrees` that converts an angle from radians to degrees.

First, let's define the function in C++:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int radians_to_degrees(double radians) {
    return static_cast<int>(radians * 180 / M_PI);
}
```

Now, let's write the corresponding Catch2 test case:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"

// Function to convert radians to degrees
int radians_to_degrees(double radians) {
    return static_cast<int>(radians * 180 / M_PI);
}

TEST_CASE("Convert radians to degrees", "[conversion]") {
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(0.0) == 0);
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(M_PI / 6) == 30);
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(M_PI / 4) == 45);
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(M_PI / 2) == 90);
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(M_PI) == 180);
    REQUIRE(radians_to_degrees(2 * M_PI) == 360);
}
```

In this C++ code:
- We include the necessary headers (`<cmath>` for mathematical functions and `<iostream>` for input/output).
- We define the `radians_to_degrees` function, which performs the conversion.
- We use the `TEST_CASE` macro from Catch2 to create a test case named "Convert radians to degrees".
- Inside the test case, we use the `REQUIRE` macro to assert that the function returns the expected values for various inputs.

To run these tests, make sure you have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your project. If you're using a build system like CMake, you can add the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(Catch2 REQUIRED)
add_executable(your_test_executable your_test_file.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test_executable PRIVATE Catch2::Catch2WithMain)
```

Then, you can build and run your tests using your preferred build tool.
