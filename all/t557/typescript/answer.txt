Here is the equivalent TypeScript function for your Python function:

```typescript
function radiansToDegrees(radians: number): number {
    /**
     * Convert an angle from radians to degrees.
     *
     * @param radians - The angle in radians to convert.
     * @returns The angle in degrees.
     */
    return radians * (180 / Math.PI);
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `number` instead of `float` and the arrow function syntax `(radians: number): number => { ... }` to define functions. Also note that we need to import or declare `Math.PI` since it's not available by default in TypeScript.
