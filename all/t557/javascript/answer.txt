Here is the equivalent JavaScript function:

```javascript
function radiansToDegrees(radians) {
    /**
     * Convert an angle from radians to degrees.
     *
     * @param {number} radians - The angle in radians to convert.
     * @return {number} The angle in degrees.
     */
    
    return radians * (180 / Math.PI);
}
```

In this JavaScript function, we use `Math.PI` instead of `pi` because JavaScript's Math object provides a constant for Ï€. Also, unlike Python where type hints can be included directly within the function definition, JavaScript does not support type hints natively. However, you can use external libraries like JSDoc to include documentation about the types of arguments and return values.
