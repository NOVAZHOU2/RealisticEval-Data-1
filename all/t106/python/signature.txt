To convert the provided JavaScript function signature and its documentation comment to Python, you can use Python's docstring format. Hereâ€™s how it would look:
python
def is_base64_image(image_data: str) -> None:
    """
    Checks if the provided image data is a valid Base64 encoded image string.

    Args:
        image_data (str): The image data string to be validated.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation will go here
Explanation:
Function Definition: The function is defined as is_base64_image, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Type Annotations:
image_data: str indicates that image_data should be of type string.
-> None indicates that this function does not return a value (you can adjust this to the actual return type once the implementation is complete).
Docstring: The docstring provides a brief description of the function, similar to the JavaScript comments, and specifies the type and purpose of the parameter.
Example of a Complete Function:
If you were to implement this function, it would look like this:
python
import re

def is_base64_image(image_data: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the provided image data is a valid Base64 encoded image string.

    Args:
        image_data (str): The image data string to be validated.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the image data is a valid Base64 encoded image string, False otherwise.
    """
    if not isinstance(image_data, str) or image_data.strip() == '':
        return False

    base64_image_pattern = r'^data:image/(jpeg|png|gif|bmp|webp);base64,[A-Za-z0-9+/]+={0,2}$'
    return re.match(base64_image_pattern, image_data) is not None
This complete function now checks if the provided image data is a valid Base64 encoded image string, including the necessary imports, logic, and return type.
