To convert the JavaScript code signature to a Python code signature, you can follow the conventions used in Python for function definition and type annotations. Below is the equivalent Python function signature along with a docstring that describes the function parameters and return type.
Python Code Signature
python
def rgb_to_hsl(r: int, g: int, b: int) -> dict:
    """
    Converts an RGB color value to HSL.

    Args:
        r (int): The red component (0-255).
        g (int): The green component (0-255).
        b (int): The blue component (0-255).

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the HSL values.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation
Function Name: The function name is changed to rgb_to_hsl, following the Python naming convention (snake_case).
Parameters: Each parameter (r, g, b) is annotated with the type int, indicating that they are expected to be integers.
Return Type: The return type is specified as dict, which indicates that the function will return a dictionary containing HSL values.
Docstring: The docstring follows the Google style, providing a clear explanation of the function's purpose, its arguments, and the return value.
You can fill in the implementation of the function as needed.
