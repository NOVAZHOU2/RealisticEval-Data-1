Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function that converts an RGB color value to HSL:
python
def rgb_to_hsl(r, g, b):
    # Convert RGB to the [0, 1] range
    r /= 255
    g /= 255
    b /= 255

    max_val = max(r, g, b)
    min_val = min(r, g, b)
    
    # Initialize HSL values
    h, s, l = 0, 0, (max_val + min_val) / 2

    if max_val == min_val:
        h = s = 0  # Achromatic
    else:
        d = max_val - min_val
        s = d / (2 - max_val - min_val) if l > 0.5 else d / (max_val + min_val)

        if max_val == r:
            h = (g - b) / d + (6 if g < b else 0)
        elif max_val == g:
            h = (b - r) / d + 2
        elif max_val == b:
            h = (r - g) / d + 4

        h /= 6

    # Convert hue to degrees
    h = round(h * 360)
    # Convert saturation and lightness to percentage
    s = round(s * 100)
    l = round(l * 100)

    return {'h': h, 's': s, 'l': l}

# Example usage:
rgb_color = (255, 0, 0)  # Red
hsl_color = rgb_to_hsl(*rgb_color)
print(hsl_color)  # Output: {'h': 0, 's': 100, 'l': 50}
Explanation of the Python Code
Function Definition: The function rgb_to_hsl takes three parameters, r, g, and b, which represent the red, green, and blue components of a color.
Normalization: The RGB values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Finding Min and Max: The maximum and minimum values among the normalized RGB components are calculated.
Lightness Calculation: Lightness 
l is calculated as the average of the maximum and minimum values.
Hue and Saturation Calculation:
If the maximum and minimum values are equal, the color is achromatic (i.e., grayscale), and hue
h and saturation
s are set to 0.
Otherwise, the difference
d between the max and min values is used to calculate saturation
s and hue
h based on which color channel is the maximum.
Converting Hue to Degrees: Hue is multiplied by 360 to convert it to degrees.
Rounding Values: The hue, saturation, and lightness values are rounded to their nearest integer.
Return Value: The function returns a dictionary containing the HSL values.
Example Usage
The example at the end shows how to use the function to convert an RGB color (red) to its HSL equivalent.
