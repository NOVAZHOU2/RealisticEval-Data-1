Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments converted from your JavaScript example:

```java
/**
 * Count the number of dashes in a string.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to count dash characters.
 * @return The total count of dash characters found in the string.
 */
public static int countDashes(String str) {
}
```
