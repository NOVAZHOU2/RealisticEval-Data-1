Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code with the same signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Count the number of dashes in a string.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to count dash characters.
 * @return The total count of dash characters found in the string.
 */
public int countDashes(String str) {
}
```

In Java, the method signature includes the return type (`int`), the method name (`countDashes`), and the parameter list (`String str`). The comments are kept intact to describe what the method does.
