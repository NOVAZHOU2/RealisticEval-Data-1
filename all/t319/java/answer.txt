Here's how you can convert your JavaScript function into Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(countDashes("This is a test-string with dashes--"));
    }

    /**
     * Count the number of dashes in a string
     *
     * @param str The string from which to count dash characters.
     * @return The total count of dash characters found in the string.
     */
    public static int countDashes(String str) {
        if (str == null) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) == '-') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

In this Java version:
- I've defined the `countDashes` method inside a `Main` class. This is because Java requires all executable code to be contained within classes.
- The method takes a single parameter, `String str`, and returns an integer representing the count of dash characters.
- A simple loop iterates over each character in the string, incrementing a counter whenever it encounters a dash (`'-'`).
