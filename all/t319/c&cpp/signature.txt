Here's the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of dashes in a string
 *
 * @param str - The string from which to count dash characters.
 * @return The total count of dash characters found in the string.
 */
int countDashes(const std::string& str);
```

In this C++ version:
- `std::string` is used instead of `{string}` to represent a string.
- The function returns an `int` instead of `{number}` to represent a numerical value.
- The parameter `str` is passed by const reference (`const std::string&`) to avoid unnecessary copying of the string and to indicate that the function does not modify the input string.
