Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments that match your JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of dashes in a string.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to count dash characters.
 * @returns The total count of dash characters found in the string.
 */
int countDashes(const std::string& str) {
}
```

This keeps the original structure and comments while using C++ syntax. You can then implement the function body as needed.
