Sure! Here is the equivalent Python function for your JavaScript code:

```python
def count_dashes(s):
    """
    Count the number of dashes in a string.

    :param s: The string from which to count dash characters.
    :type s: str
    :return: The total count of dash characters found in the string.
    :rtype: int
    """
    return s.count('-')
```

This Python function `count_dashes` takes a single argument `s`, which is the string you want to count dashes in. It uses the `str.count()` method to count occurrences of the dash character (`'-'`) and returns that count.
