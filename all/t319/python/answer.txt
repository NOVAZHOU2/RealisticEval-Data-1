Here’s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function countDashes into Python code.
Original JavaScript Code
Here’s the JavaScript code for reference:
javascript
function countDashes(str) {
    let dashCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === '-') {
            dashCount++;
        }
    }
    return dashCount;
}
Converted Python Code
Below is the equivalent Python code:
python
def count_dashes(s: str) -> int:
    """Count the number of dashes in a string.

    Args:
        s (str): The string to count dashes in.

    Returns:
        int: The total count of dashes found in the string.
    """
    dash_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '-':
            dash_count += 1
    return dash_count
Explanation of the Python Code
Function Definition:
The function is defined using the def keyword, with a name count_dashes. It takes one argument s, which is expected to be a string.
Type Hinting:
The function signature includes type hints, indicating that the parameter is a string (str) and the return type is an integer (int).
Docstring:
A docstring is added to explain the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value.
Count Initialization:
The variable dash_count is initialized to zero to keep track of the number of dashes.
Looping Through the String:
A for loop iterates through each character in the string s.
The condition checks if the current character (char) is a dash ('-'). If it is, dash_count is incremented.
Return Statement:
Finally, the function returns the total count of dashes found in the string.
Example Usage
Here’s how you could use the function:
python
# Example usage
result = count_dashes('Hello - World - This - is - a - test')
print(result)  # Output: 5
This will correctly count the number of dashes in the input string.
