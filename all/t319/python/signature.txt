Sure, here is the equivalent Python code with the same signature and comments:

```python
"""
Count the number of dashes in a string

:param str: The string from which to count dash characters.
:type str: str
:return: The total count of dash characters found in the string.
:rtype: int
"""

def count_dashes(s):
    pass
```

In Python, we use docstrings to provide documentation for functions, similar to JavaScript's JSDoc comments. The `:type` and `:rtype` tags help clarify the types of parameters and return values, respectively.
