Here’s the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code, organized within the package `org.real.temp` and the class `Answer`. I will use Java’s capabilities to perform the required operations:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Calculate the midpoints from a given array of edges.
     *
     * @param edges An array of edge values.
     * @return An array of midpoints calculated from the edges.
     */
    public static double[] getMidsFromEdges(double[] edges) {
        // Ensure edges is not null
        if (edges == null || edges.length < 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Edges array must have at least two elements.");
        }

        // Calculate midpoints
        double[] mids = new double[edges.length - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length - 1; i++) {
            mids[i] = (edges[i] + edges[i + 1]) / 2;
        }

        return mids;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] edges = {1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0};
        double[] mids = getMidsFromEdges(edges);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(mids));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package and Class Declaration**: The code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;` and the class declaration `public class Answer`.
2. **Method Signature**: The method `getMidsFromEdges` is defined as a static method that takes an array of doubles (`double[] edges`) and returns an array of doubles (`double[]`).
3. **Input Validation**: The method checks if the input array is null or has fewer than two elements, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if so.
4. **Midpoint Calculation**: A new array `mids` is created to store the midpoints. A loop iterates through the `edges` array, calculating the midpoint between each pair of adjacent elements.
5. **Main Method**: A sample usage of the `getMidsFromEdges` method is demonstrated in the `main` method, where an example array is passed to the method, and the resulting midpoints are printed.

This Java code maintains the functionality and logic of the original Python code while adhering to Java's syntax and best practices.
