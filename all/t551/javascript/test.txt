Here is how you can convert your Python unittest test class into a JavaScript test case using Jest:

```javascript
const { getMidsFromEdges } = require('./yourModule'); // replace 'yourModule' with the path to your module

describe('getMidsFromEdges', () => {
  it('should calculate midpoints correctly for an array of edges', () => {
    const edges = [0, 1, 2];
    const expectedOutput = [0.5, 1.5];

    expect(getMidsFromEdges(edges)).toEqual(expectedOutput);
  });
});
```

In the above JavaScript code, `describe` function is used to group related tests together and `it` function is used to write individual tests. The `expect` function is used to assert that the result of the function call is equal to the expected output. 

Please note that in order to run the test, you need to have Node.js and Jest installed on your machine. Also, replace `'./yourModule'` with the actual path to your JavaScript file where `getMidsFromEdges` function is defined.
