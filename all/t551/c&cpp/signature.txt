Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Calculate the midpoints from a given vector of edges.
 * For example:
 *     input: {0, 1, 2}
 *     output: {0.5, 1.5}
 *
 * @param edges A vector of edge values.
 * @return A vector of midpoints calculated from the edges.
 */
std::vector<double> getMidsFromEdges(const std::vector<int>& edges);
```

This C++ function signature uses `std::vector` instead of `numpy.ndarray`, and the return type is `std::vector<double>` to store the midpoints. The function takes a constant reference to a vector of integers as its argument.
