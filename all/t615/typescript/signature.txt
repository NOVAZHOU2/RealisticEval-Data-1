Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code with the appropriate adjustments for type annotations and documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the average of the last 'period' integers in the given array of values.
 *
 * @param {number[]} values - The array of integers from which to calculate the average.
 * @param {number} period - The number of last elements to include in the average calculation.
 * @returns {number} - The average of the last 'period' integers, or NaN if the input array
 *                     does not contain enough elements or if the period is invalid (<= 0).
 */
function calculate(values: number[], period: number): number {
    // Implementation goes here...
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Documentation Comments**: Python docstrings are converted to JSDoc style comments.
2. **Type Annotations**: `List[int]` is changed to `number[]`, and the return type is adjusted from `float` to `number`.
3. **Clarification of Return Value**: The mention of `math.nan` in Python is replaced with `NaN` in TypeScript.

This TypeScript signature maintains the original functionality and structure while adhering to TypeScript conventions.
