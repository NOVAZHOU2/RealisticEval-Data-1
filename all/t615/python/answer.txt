To convert the provided Java code to Python, we will create a Python class that has a method equivalent to the calculate method in the Java code. Hereâ€™s the converted code in Python:
python
from typing import List
import math

class Answer:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate(values: List[int], period: int) -> float:
        # Check if the number of values is less than the specified period
        if values is None or len(values) < period or period <= 0:
            return float('nan')  # Return NaN for invalid input
        
        sum_values = 0.0  # Initialize the sum
        
        # Calculate the sum of the last 'period' values
        for i in range(len(values) - period, len(values)):
            sum_values += values[i]
        
        # Return the average of the last 'period' values
        return sum_values / period
Explanation of the Code:
Imports: We import List from the typing module for type hinting, and math for the NaN constant.
Class Definition: The class Answer is defined with a static method calculate.
Method Implementation:
Input Validation: Similar to Java, we check if values is None, its length is less than period, or if period is less than or equal to zero. If any of these conditions are true, we return float('nan'), which represents "Not a Number" in Python.
Sum Calculation: We initialize sum_values to 0.0 and use a loop to sum the last period elements of the values list.
Return Value: Finally, we return the average by dividing the total sum by period.
Usage:
You can use this class and method in the following way:
python
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
period = 3
result = Answer.calculate(values, period)
print(result)  # Output will be 4.0
This implementation keeps the logic and structure of the Java code while conforming to Python syntax and conventions.
