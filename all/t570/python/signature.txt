To convert the TypeScript code signature into a Python function signature while preserving the comments, you can follow the syntax and typing conventions used in Python. Hereâ€™s how the conversion would look:
python
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

# Define a type alias for a plain object (dictionary)
PlainObject = Dict[str, Any]

def deep_merge_objects(obj1: PlainObject, obj2: Optional[PlainObject]) -> PlainObject:
    """ 
    Deeply merges two objects.
    
    If properties are objects in both objects, they are recursively merged.
    If a property exists in both objects but is not an object, the value from obj1 is used.

    Args:
        obj1: The first object to merge.
        obj2: The second object to merge, which can be None.

    Returns:
        A new object that is the result of the merge.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation of the Changes:
Type Aliases:
The TypeScript type PlainObject defined as { [key: string]: any } is represented in Python using Dict[str, Any].
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def in Python.
The Optional type is used for obj2 to indicate that it can be either PlainObject or None, similar to how TypeScript allows for null or undefined.
Docstring Comments:
The comments have been converted into a docstring format, which is the standard for Python documentation.
The @param and @returns tags from TypeScript are replaced with Args and Returns in the Python docstring.
Placeholder Implementation:
The body of the function contains a pass statement to indicate where the implementation would go, similar to the empty body in the TypeScript version.
