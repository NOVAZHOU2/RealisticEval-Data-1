Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided TypeScript Jest test cases into Python test cases using the unittest framework. The conversion involves restructuring the test cases to fit Python's syntax and conventions while retaining the logic of each test.
Converted Python Code Using unittest
python
import unittest

def deep_merge_objects(obj1, obj2):
    # Placeholder for the actual implementation of deep_merge_objects
    pass

class TestDeepMergeObjects(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_handles_null_values_in_obj2(self):
        obj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
        obj2 = None
        result = deep_merge_objects(obj1, obj2)
        self.assertEqual(result, obj1)  # Should return obj1

    def test_handles_undefined_values_in_obj2(self):
        obj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
        obj2 = None  # Python's equivalent of undefined is None
        result = deep_merge_objects(obj1, obj2)
        self.assertEqual(result, obj1)  # Should return obj1

    def test_merges_deeply_nested_objects(self):
        obj1 = {'a': {'b': {'c': 1}}, 'd': 2}
        obj2 = {'a': {'b': {'d': 3}}, 'e': 4}
        result = deep_merge_objects(obj1, obj2)
        self.assertEqual(result, {
            'a': {
                'b': {
                    'c': 1
                }
            },
            'd': 2
        })

    def test_does_not_merge_arrays_but_takes_them_from_obj1(self):
        obj1 = {'a': [1, 2, 3]}
        obj2 = {'a': [4, 5]}
        result = deep_merge_objects(obj1, obj2)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': [1, 2, 3]})  # Should keep array from obj1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Explanation of the Changes:
Importing the unittest Module:
The unittest module is imported at the beginning to facilitate the creation and running of test cases.
Defining the Function:
A placeholder for the deep_merge_objects function is defined, where the actual implementation would go.
Creating the Test Class:
A test class TestDeepMergeObjects is defined, inheriting from unittest.TestCase. This class encapsulates all the test methods.
Test Methods:
Each test case from the TypeScript Jest format is converted into a method within the TestDeepMergeObjects class.
The test method in Jest corresponds to methods in the unittest class prefixed with test_.
Assertions:
The expect(result).toEqual(...) assertions are replaced with self.assertEqual(...) in Python, which is the standard way to assert equality in unittest.
Handling undefined:
In Python, the equivalent of JavaScript's undefined is None, so both cases where obj2 is undefined in TypeScript are set to None.
Running the Tests:
The conditional if __name__ == '__main__': is included at the bottom to allow the script to be run directly and execute the tests.
This conversion maintains the logic of the tests while adhering to Python's syntax and the conventions of the unittest framework. Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!
