Here's the Java code signature with comments maintained, corresponding to your TypeScript code:

```java
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Deeply merges two objects.
 * If properties are objects in both objects, they are recursively merged.
 * If a property exists in both objects but is not an object, the value from obj1 is used.
 *
 * @param obj1 - The first object to merge.
 * @param obj2 - The second object to merge.
 * @returns A new object that is the result of the merge.
 */
public static Map<String, Object> deepMergeObjects(Map<String, Object> obj1, Map<String, Object> obj2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Changes:
1. **Imports**: Added `import java.util.Map;` for the `Map` type.
2. **Method Signature**: Changed the method signature to Java, using `Map<String, Object>` for both parameters and the return type.
3. **Comments**: Kept the original comments intact for clarity.
