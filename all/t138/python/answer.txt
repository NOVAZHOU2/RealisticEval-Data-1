Here is the equivalent Python code that performs the same functionality as your JavaScript function, including the docstring and punctuation removal logic using regular expressions:
python
import re

def remove_punctuation(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
    and trims whitespace from both ends.

    Args:
        s (str): The string from which to remove punctuation.

    Returns:
        str: The cleaned and formatted string.
    """
    # Define a regex pattern that matches common punctuation characters.
    # This includes Unicode punctuation and ASCII punctuation.
    punctuation_regex = r'[\u2000-\u206F\u2E00-\u2E7F!"#$%&\'()*+,\-./:;<=>?@[\\\]^_`{|}~]'
    
    # Replace punctuation with an empty string, convert to lowercase, and trim whitespace.
    return re.sub(punctuation_regex, '', s).lower().strip()

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    example_string = "Hello, World! This is a test string."
    cleaned_string = remove_punctuation(example_string)
    print(cleaned_string)  # Output: "hello world this is a test string"
Breakdown of the Python Code:
Imports:
The re module is imported for regular expression operations.
Function Definition:
The function is named remove_punctuation, following the Python convention of using snake_case.
Docstring:
The docstring explains the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
Regular Expression:
The regular expression punctuation_regex matches common punctuation characters, including both Unicode and ASCII characters.
Replacing Punctuation:
The re.sub() function is used to replace all matching punctuation characters with an empty string. The string is then converted to lowercase and trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace using .lower().strip().
Example Usage:
An example is provided to demonstrate how the function can be used, and the cleaned string is printed.
Running the Code
To execute this code, simply copy it into a Python file (e.g., remove_punctuation.py) and run it in a Python environment:
bash
python remove_punctuation.py
This will output the cleaned and formatted string without punctuation.
