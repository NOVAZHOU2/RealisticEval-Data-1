To convert the JavaScript function signature and its documentation comment into Python code signature with an appropriate docstring, you can follow this format:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
 * and trims whitespace from both ends.
 *
 * @param {string} str - The string from which to remove punctuation.
 * @returns {string} The cleaned and formatted string.
 */
function removePunctuation(str) {}
Equivalent Python Code Signature
python
def remove_punctuation(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
    and trims whitespace from both ends.

    Args:
        s (str): The string from which to remove punctuation.

    Returns:
        str: The cleaned and formatted string.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for implementation
Breakdown of the Python Code Signature:
Function Definition:
The function is named remove_punctuation, using the snake_case naming convention typical in Python.
Type Hints:
The parameter s is annotated with the type str, indicating it expects a string.
The return type is indicated with -> str, specifying that the function will return a string.
Docstring:
A docstring is provided, similar to the JavaScript comment, explaining the function's purpose, its parameters (Args), and its return value (Returns).
Placeholder:
The pass statement is included as a placeholder for the actual implementation of the function.
This structure is suitable for any future implementation of the remove_punctuation function in Python.
