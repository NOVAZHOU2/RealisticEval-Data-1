Sure! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments reflecting the same functionality as your JavaScript code:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
 * and trims whitespace from both ends.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to remove punctuation.
 * @returns The cleaned and formatted string.
 */
std::string removePunctuation(const std::string& str) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function signature uses `std::string` as the return type and takes a constant reference to a `std::string` as a parameter.
- The comments are preserved and adapted to C++ style, keeping the original meaning. You can implement the function body as needed.
