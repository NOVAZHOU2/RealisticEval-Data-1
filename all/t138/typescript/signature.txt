Here’s the TypeScript code signature with comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
 * and trims whitespace from both ends.
 *
 * @param {string} str - The string from which to remove punctuation.
 * @returns {string} The cleaned and formatted string.
 */
function removePunctuation(str: string): string {
    
}
```

Is there anything else you’d like to delve into regarding this conversion?
