Hereâ€™s the Java code signature that mirrors the JavaScript code signature while retaining the comments:

```java
/**
 * Removes all punctuation from a given string, converts the string to lowercase,
 * and trims whitespace from both ends.
 *
 * @param str The string from which to remove punctuation.
 * @return The cleaned and formatted string.
 */
public static String removePunctuation(String str) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Notes:
- The method is declared as `public static` to indicate that it can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- The parameter type is specified as `String`, and the return type is also `String`.
