Here's the equivalent Python code signature with the comments converted to Python style. The code comments are preserved, and the formatting is adjusted to fit Python conventions.
python
def hill_sort(arr):
    """
    Brief: Sorts a list of integers using the Hill Sort (Shell Sort) algorithm.

    Parameters:
    arr (list of int): A list of integers that will be sorted in-place.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The C++ function hillSort is translated to Python as hill_sort, following Python naming conventions (PEP 8).
Docstring:
The C++ comment block is converted into a Python docstring, which is the standard way to document functions in Python.
The format is adapted to be more Pythonic, using "Brief" for the description and "Parameters" for the parameters.
Parameter Type:
The parameter type is specified as list of int in the docstring, indicating that arr is a list of integers.
Pass Statement:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function implementation.
This structure allows you to implement the sorting algorithm later while maintaining clear documentation about the function's purpose and parameters.
