Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature with comments adapted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Sorts an array of integers using the Hill Sort (Shell Sort) algorithm.
 *
 * @param arr An array of integers that will be sorted in-place.
 *
 */
function hillSort(arr: number[]): void {}
```

This conversion maintains the original functionality and structure while adhering to TypeScript conventions.
