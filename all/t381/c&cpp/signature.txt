Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature for the provided Python function `extract_email_details`. The comments have been kept similar to maintain clarity.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <tuple>

/**
 * Extracts the username and mailbox suffix from an email address.
 * For example, extractEmailDetails("xxx@gmail.com") returns ('xxx', 'gmail.com').
 *
 * @param email The email address to extract details from.
 * @return A tuple containing the username and domain.
 */
std::tuple<std::string, std::string> extractEmailDetails(const std::string& email);
```

This C++ function signature follows the same structure as the original Python function, including the parameter type (`const std::string&`) and the return type (`std::tuple<std::string, std::string>`). The docstring has been adapted to fit C++ commenting conventions.
