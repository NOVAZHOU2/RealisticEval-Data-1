Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function for your Python code:

```javascript
function extractEmailDetails(email) {
    /**
     * Extracts the username and mailbox suffix from an email address.
     * eg extractEmailDetails("xxx@gmail.com") returns ['xxx', 'gmail.com']
     * 
     * @param {string} email - The email address to extract details from.
     * @returns {Array} An array containing the username and domain.
     */
    
    // Split the email address at the '@' symbol
    const parts = email.split('@');
    
    // Check if the email has exactly two parts
    if (parts.length !== 2) {
        throw new Error('Invalid email format');
    }
    
    // Return the username and domain as an array
    return [parts[0], parts[1]];
}
```

This JavaScript function does the same thing as your Python function. It splits the email address at the `@` symbol and returns the username and domain as an array. If the email format is invalid (i.e., it doesn't contain exactly one `@` symbol), it throws an error.
