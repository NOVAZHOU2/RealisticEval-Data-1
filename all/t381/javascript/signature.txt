Certainly! Below is the JavaScript version of the Python function `extract_email_details`, with comments kept intact:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the username and mailbox suffix from an email address.
 * e.g. extractEmailDetails("xxx@gmail.com") returns ['xxx', 'gmail.com']
 *
 * @param {string} email - The email address to extract details from.
 * @returns {Array} An array containing the username and domain.
 */
function extractEmailDetails(email) {
    // Split the email address at the '@' symbol
    const parts = email.split('@');

    // Check if the email contains exactly one '@' symbol
    if (parts.length !== 2) {
        throw new Error('Invalid email format');
    }

    // Extract the username and domain
    const username = parts[0];
    const domain = parts[1];

    return [username, domain];
}
```

This JavaScript function does the same thing as the provided Python function: it splits the email address into a username and domain based on the '@' symbol. It also includes error handling to ensure that the email format is correct.
