Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts the username and mailbox suffix from an email address.
 * Example: extractEmailDetails("xxx@gmail.com") returns ['xxx', 'gmail.com']
 * 
 * @param {string} email - The email address to extract details from.
 * 
 * @returns {Array} An array containing the username and domain.
 */
function extractEmailDetails(email) {
    // Function body would go here
}
```

Please note that the return type is described as an Array in JavaScript, since tuples do not exist as a distinct data type in JavaScript, but can be represented as arrays. The example also uses the JavaScript convention for describing the return value as an array. 

Remember, in actual implementation, you need to parse the email string to get the username and domain, but I've omitted the body of the function to focus on the function signature and comments conversion.
