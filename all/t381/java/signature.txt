Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code with the same functionality and comments:

```java
/**
 * Extracts the username and mailbox suffix from an email address.
 * e.g. extractEmailDetails("xxx@gmail.com") returns ("xxx", "gmail.com")
 *
 * @param email the email address to extract details from
 * @return a tuple containing the username and domain
 */
public static String[] extractEmailDetails(String email) {
    // Split the email address using "@" as the delimiter
    String[] parts = email.split("@");
    
    // Check if the email has exactly two parts (username and domain)
    if (parts.length != 2) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email format");
    }
    
    // Return the username and domain as an array
    return new String[]{parts[0], parts[1]};
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Method Signature**: The method `extractEmailDetails` takes a single parameter `email` of type `String` and returns an array of `String`.
- **Comments**: The comments in the Java version are similar to those in the Python version, explaining what the method does and providing an example usage.
- **Splitting the Email**: The email string is split using the `@` symbol as the delimiter.
- **Validation**: It checks if the resulting array has exactly two parts (username and domain). If not, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- **Return Value**: The method returns an array containing the username and domain.

This Java method should work similarly to the provided Python function.
