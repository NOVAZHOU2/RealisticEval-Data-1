Certainly! Below is the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function, including the documentation comments in the JSDoc style.

```typescript
/**
 * Solve the Eight Queens problem. If a solution is found, it will print out the configuration of the chessboard.
 * If all queens cannot be placed, print "No solution".
 * Example output:
 * 
 * . . Q . . . . .
 * . . . . Q . . .
 * . Q . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . Q
 * . . . . . Q . .
 * . . . Q . . . .
 * . . . . . . Q .
 * Q . . . . . . .
 */
function eightQueens(): void {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function signature preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python function, and the documentation comments have been translated to the JSDoc style. The function does not return any value (hence `void`), which aligns with the Python function's behavior of printing results rather than returning them.
