Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided Python function, including the comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Solve the Eight Queens problem. If a solution is found, it will print out the configuration of the chessboard.
 * If all queens cannot be placed, it prints "No solution".
 * Example output:
 * . . Q . . . . .
 * . . . . Q . . .
 * . Q . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . Q
 * . . . . . Q . .
 * . . . Q . . . .
 * . . . . . . Q .
 * Q . . . . . . .
 */
function eightQueens() {
    // Implementation of the eightQueens function goes here
}
```

This function signature and comments have been translated to JavaScript, and the comments have been formatted according to JSDoc standards. You can now add the implementation inside the `eightQueens` function as needed.
