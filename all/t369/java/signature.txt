Sure, here's how you can translate the Python function signature into a Java method signature while keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Solve the Eight Queens problem. If a solution is found, it will print out the configuration of the chessboard.
 * If all queens cannot be placed, it will print "No solution".
 *
 * Print example:
 * . . Q . . . . .
 * . . . . Q . . .
 * . Q . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . Q
 * . . . . . Q . .
 * . . . Q . . . .
 * . . . . . . Q .
 * Q . . . . . . .
 */
public void eightQueens() {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, the `void` keyword indicates that the method does not return any value. The method name and its parameters (if any) follow the same naming conventions as in Python. The docstring in Java is typically enclosed within Javadoc-style comments (`/** ... */`).
