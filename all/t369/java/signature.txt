Sure, here is the equivalent Java method signature along with the Javadoc comments:

```java
public class ChessBoard {

    /**
     * Solves the Eight Queens problem. If a solution is found, it prints out the configuration of the chessboard.
     * If all queens cannot be placed, it prints "No solution".
     * Example output:
     * <pre>
     * . . Q . . . . .
     * . . . . Q . . .
     * . Q . . . . . .
     * . . . . . . . Q
     * . . . . . Q . .
     * . . . Q . . . .
     * . . . . . . Q .
     * Q . . . . . . .
     * </pre>
     */
    public void eightQueens() {
        // Method implementation goes here
    }
}
```

In this Java version:
- The method `eight_queens` is renamed to `eightQueens` to follow Java naming conventions (camelCase).
- The method is defined within a class named `ChessBoard`.
- The Javadoc comment includes an example of the expected output using the `<pre>` tag for better readability.
