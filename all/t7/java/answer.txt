Sure, here's how you can translate the Python code into Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Answer {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Answer.class.getName());

    public void log(Level level, String message) {
        LOGGER.log(level, message);
    }
}
```

In this Java code:
- We use `java.util.logging` package which provides the functionality similar to Python's `logging` module.
- The `Logger` object is initialized using `Logger.getLogger(Answer.class.getName())`, which ensures that each class has its own logger.
- The `log` method takes a `Level` and a `String` message and logs it using `LOGGER.log`.

Make sure you have the necessary imports at the beginning of your file. This code should be placed in a file named `Answer.java`.
