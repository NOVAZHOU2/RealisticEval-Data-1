Here's the equivalent TypeScript code signature for your Python class, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
import { Level } from 'some-logging-library'; // Replace 'some-logging-library' with the actual library you're using

/**
 * Represents a logger that can be used to log messages at different levels.
 */
export class Logger {
    /**
     * Creates a new logger instance.
     *
     * @param name - The name of the logger, typically set to `__name__` to reference the module name.
     * @param level - The logging level, defaulting to `Level.DEBUG`.
     */
    constructor(name: string, level?: Level);

    /**
     * Logs a message at the specified level.
     *
     * @param level - The logging level for the message (e.g., `Level.INFO`).
     * @param message - The log message.
     */
    log(level: Level, message: string): void;
}
```

### Notes:
1. **TypeScript Imports**: Ensure you have the correct type definitions for the logging library you're using. If you're using a standard logging library like `winston`, you might need to install it and use its types.
2. **Enum for Levels**: Depending on the logging library you choose, you might want to define an enum for the logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, etc.) or use the existing ones provided by the library.
3. **Optional Parameters**: In TypeScript, parameters can be marked as optional by adding a question mark (`?`) after the parameter name in the constructor signature.

Make sure to adjust the import statement and any other details according to your specific setup and requirements.
