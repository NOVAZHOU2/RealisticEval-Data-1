Sure! Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided Python unittest test class into a TypeScript test case using Jest's `describe` and `it` syntax.

### Python Unittest Code
```python
import logging
import unittest

class Logger:
    def __init__(self, name, level=logging.DEBUG):
        """
        Initializes a new logger instance.

        :param name: Name of the logger, typically __name__ to reference the module name.
        :param level: Logging level, default is DEBUG.
        """

    def log(self, level, message):
        """
        Logs a message with the given level.

        :param level: Logging level for the message (e.g., logging.INFO).
        :param message: Log message.
        """

class TestLogger(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_logger_initialization(self):
        logger = Logger("test_logger")
        self.assertIsNotNone(logger)

    def test_log_message(self):
        logger = Logger("test_logger")
        # Assuming we implement the log function to actually log something
        logger.log(logging.INFO, "This is a test log")
        # Here you would check if the log was indeed made (mocking or some assertion)
```

### TypeScript Jest Test Case
```typescript
import { Logger } from './logger'; // Adjust the import based on your file structure

describe('Logger', () => {
    it('should initialize the logger', () => {
        const logger = new Logger('test_logger');
        expect(logger).toBeDefined();
    });

    it('should log a message', () => {
        const logger = new Logger('test_logger');
        // Assuming we implement the log function to actually log something
        logger.log('info', 'This is a test log');
        // Here you would check if the log was indeed made (mocking or some assertion)
    });
});
```

### Notes
- Adjust the import path for the `Logger` class based on your project structure.
- The logging functionality will need to be implemented in the `Logger` class for the tests to be meaningful.
- In the second test, you might want to use a mock or spy to verify that the logging was executed correctly.
