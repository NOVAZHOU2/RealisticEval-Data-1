To convert the provided TypeScript Jest test cases to Python's unittest framework, we'll follow these steps:
Set up the Test Case Class: In Python, we typically create a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Define Test Methods: Each test case is defined as a method that starts with the word "test".
Use Assertions: Instead of expect from Jest, we will use assertions provided by the unittest framework.
Below is the converted Python code:
python
import unittest
import base64

def base64_to_bytes(base64_string: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Converts a Base64-encoded string to a bytes object.

    :param base64_string: The Base64-encoded string to convert.
    :returns: A bytes object representing the decoded bytes.
    """
    return base64.b64decode(base64_string)

class TestBase64ToBytes(unittest.TestCase):
    
    # Test Case 1
    def test_decode_hello_world(self):
        base64_string = "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
        expected = "Hello, World!"
        array_buffer = base64_to_bytes(base64_string)
        result = array_buffer.decode('utf-8')
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    # Test Case 2
    def test_decode_some_text(self):
        base64_string = "U29tZSB0ZXh0IHdpdGggc3BhcmluZyBhbmQgd29ya2luZyE="
        expected = "Some text with sparing and working!"
        array_buffer = base64_to_bytes(base64_string)
        result = array_buffer.decode('utf-8')
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    # Test Case 3
    def test_decode_base64_encoding(self):
        base64_string = "QmFzZTY0IGVuY29kaW5nIGlzIGEgY29tbW9ubG9nIEZvciBiaW5hcnkgZGF0YQ=="
        expected = "Base64 encoding is a common log For binary data"
        array_buffer = base64_to_bytes(base64_string)
        result = array_buffer.decode('utf-8')
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    # Test Case 4
    def test_decode_give_me_path(self):
        base64_string = "R2l2ZSBtZSBhbG9uZyBhIHBhdGggdG8gY29tcGxldGUgc3RhcnQgcGFnZS4="
        expected = "Give me along a path to complete start page."
        array_buffer = base64_to_bytes(base64_string)
        result = array_buffer.decode('utf-8')
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Breakdown of the Code:
Importing Required Modules:
We import unittest for the test framework and base64 for decoding Base64 strings.
Defining the base64_to_bytes Function:
This function remains unchanged from the previous implementation, providing functionality to decode a Base64 string.
Creating the Test Class:
TestBase64ToBytes inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Each test case corresponds to a method that tests a specific Base64 decoding scenario.
Defining Test Methods:
Each method corresponds to a test case from the TypeScript code.
Each test case decodes the Base64 string and checks the result against the expected output using self.assertEqual.
Running the Tests:
The unittest.main() call runs all the test cases when the script is executed.
Running the Tests:
To run the tests, save the code in a .py file (e.g., test_base64.py) and execute it in a terminal or command prompt using:
bash
python test_base64.py
This will execute the tests and provide output indicating whether they passed or failed.
