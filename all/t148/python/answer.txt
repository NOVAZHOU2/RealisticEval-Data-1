To convert the provided TypeScript function base64ToArrayBuffer to Python, we need to follow these steps:
Decode the Base64 string: Use the base64 module in Python.
Create a bytes object: In Python, you can directly create bytes from the decoded Base64 string.
Return the bytes object: This will serve a similar purpose as an ArrayBuffer in TypeScript.
Here’s the equivalent Python code:
python
import base64

def base64_to_bytes(base64_string: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Converts a Base64 encoded string to a bytes object.

    :param base64_string: The Base64 string to be converted.
    :returns: A bytes object representing the decoded binary data.
    """
    # Decode the Base64 string
    binary_data = base64.b64decode(base64_string)
    
    return binary_data
Explanation of the Conversion:
Importing the Module: The base64 module is imported to handle Base64 encoding and decoding.
Function Definition:
The function name is changed from base64ToArrayBuffer to base64_to_bytes to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case).
The parameter type is specified as str, and the return type is specified as bytes.
Decoding Base64:
Instead of using atob, which is a JavaScript function, we use base64.b64decode() to decode the Base64 string into bytes.
Return Statement:
The function directly returns the decoded bytes object, which can be used similarly to an ArrayBuffer in JavaScript.
Example Usage
Here’s an example of how you might use this function:
python
# Example Base64 string (representing the string "Hello")
base64_string = "SGVsbG8="

# Convert to bytes
result = base64_to_bytes(base64_string)

# Output the result
print(result)  # Output: b'Hello'
This Python function now replicates the functionality of the original TypeScript function while adhering to Python's conventions and capabilities.
