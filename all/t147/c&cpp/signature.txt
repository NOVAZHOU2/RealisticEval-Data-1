Here's the C++ code signature with comments similar to the TypeScript version:

```cpp
/**
 * Converts a vector of uint8_t to a string.
 *
 * @param buffer - The vector of uint8_t to be converted.
 * @returns The string representation of the buffer.
 */
std::string arrayBufferToString(const std::vector<uint8_t>& buffer);
```
