To convert the provided TypeScript function arrayBufferToString into Python, we can use the bytes type and the decode method to handle the conversion. In Python, there’s no direct equivalent to JavaScript's ArrayBuffer and Uint8Array, but we can work with bytearray or bytes directly. Here’s how the code looks in Python:
python
def array_buffer_to_string(buffer: bytes) -> str:
    """
    Converts a bytes object to a string using UTF-8 decoding.

    :param buffer: A bytes object representing the data to convert.
    :returns: The decoded string.
    """
    return buffer.decode('utf-8')
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Signature:
The function is named array_buffer_to_string, using Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
The parameter type is changed from ArrayBuffer to bytes, which is the closest representation of binary data in Python.
Decoding:
The TypeScript code uses a TextDecoder to convert the Uint8Array to a string. In Python, we can use the decode method directly on the bytes object to achieve the same result.
Docstring:
A docstring has been added to describe the function and its parameters, similar to how you would document functions in Python.
Usage Example:
Here's how you could use this function in Python:
python
# Example usage
buffer = b'Hello, world!'  # A bytes object
result = array_buffer_to_string(buffer)
print(result)  # Output: Hello, world!
This implementation captures the functionality of the original TypeScript function while adhering to Python conventions.
