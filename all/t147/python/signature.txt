To convert the TypeScript function signature to Python while keeping the comments, you would write it as follows:
python
def array_buffer_to_string(buffer: bytes) -> str:
    """
    Converts an ArrayBuffer to a string.

    :param buffer: The bytes object to be converted.
    :returns: The string representation of the bytes object.
    """
Breakdown of the Conversion:
Function Name:
Converted arrayBufferToString to array_buffer_to_string to follow Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type:
Changed the parameter type from ArrayBuffer to bytes, which is the appropriate type in Python for handling binary data.
Return Type:
The return type remains str, as it is also the appropriate type for string representations in Python.
Docstring:
The comments have been converted to a docstring format in Python. The description and parameter/return information are retained and formatted according to Python conventions.
This signature accurately reflects the functionality described in the TypeScript code while conforming to Python's syntax and style.
