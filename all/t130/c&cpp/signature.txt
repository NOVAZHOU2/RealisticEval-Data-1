Here's the C++ function signature that corresponds to the JavaScript code signature, including the comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Computing PI (π) Using Gauss-Legendre Algorithm with High-precision Arithmetic Library
 *
 * @param digits - The number of decimal digits to compute π to.
 * @returns - The value of π to the specified number of digits as a string.
 */
std::string computePi(int digits) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this signature, I've used `std::string` as the return type to indicate that the function will return the value of π as a string, similar to the JavaScript implementation. Let me know if you need further assistance!
