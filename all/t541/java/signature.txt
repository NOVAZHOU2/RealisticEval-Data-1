Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript code signature to a Java code signature while keeping the comments:

```java
/**
 * Filters elements from an array based on a qualification function.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of elements in the array.
 * @param unfilteredArray The array to filter.
 * @param isQualified The function that determines if an element qualifies.
 * @return A new array containing the elements that qualify.
 */
public static <T> T[] filterArray(T[] unfilteredArray, Function<T, Boolean> isQualified) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this Java version:
- `<T>` is used to define a generic type parameter.
- `T[]` represents an array of type `T`.
- `Function<T, Boolean>` is a functional interface that takes an element of type `T` and returns a boolean indicating whether the element qualifies.

Please note that you would need to implement the body of the method according to your specific requirements.
