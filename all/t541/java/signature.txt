Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code signature for the provided JavaScript function, keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Filters elements from an array based on a qualification function.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of elements in the array.
 * @param unfilteredArray The array to filter.
 * @param isQualified The function that determines if an element qualifies.
 * @return A new array containing the elements that qualify.
 */
public static <T> T[] filterArray(T[] unfilteredArray, Predicate<T> isQualified) {
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Generics (`<T>`):** This allows the method to work with any type of object.
- **`Predicate<T> isQualified`:** This is a functional interface in Java that represents a boolean-valued function of one argument. It corresponds to the `isQualified` function in your JavaScript code.
- **Return Type:** The return type is `T[]`, which means it returns an array of the same type as the input array.

This Java method can be used similarly to your JavaScript function, filtering elements based on a given predicate.
