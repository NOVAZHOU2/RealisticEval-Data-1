Certainly! Below is the TypeScript version of your JavaScript code with the same comments and structure:

```typescript
/**
 * Filters elements from an array based on a qualification function.
 *
 * @param {Array<T>} unfilteredArray - The array to filter.
 * @param {(element: T) => boolean} isQualified - The function that determines if an element qualifies.
 * @returns {Array<T>} - A new array containing the elements that qualify.
 */
function filterArray<T>(unfilteredArray: T[], isQualified: (element: T) => boolean): T[] {
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- `T` is a type parameter that represents the type of elements in the array.
- `unfilteredArray` is typed as `T[]`, indicating it's an array of type `T`.
- `isQualified` is typed as `(element: T) => boolean`, indicating it's a function that takes an element of type `T` and returns a boolean.
- The return type of the function is also `T[]`, indicating it returns an array of type `T`.
