Here's how you can translate the JavaScript code into Python:

```python
def filter_array(unfiltered_array, is_qualified):
    """
    Filters elements from an array based on a qualification function.

    :param list unfiltered_array: The array to filter.
    :param function is_qualified: The function that determines if an element qualifies.
    :return: A new array containing the elements that qualify.
    :rtype: list
    """
```

Please note that in Python, functions do not need explicit type annotations like in TypeScript/JavaScript. If you want to specify types for parameters and return values, you would typically use type hints or static type checking tools like `mypy`. But in this case, I've removed those parts because they're optional and depend on your specific needs and coding style.
