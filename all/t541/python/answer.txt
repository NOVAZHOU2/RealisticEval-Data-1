Here's how you can convert the provided JavaScript function to Python, following the same logic and structure:
Converted Python Code
python
def filter_array(unfiltered_array, is_qualified):
    """
    Filters elements from an array based on a qualification function.

    :param unfiltered_array: The array to filter.
    :param is_qualified: The function that determines if an element qualifies.
    :return: A new list containing the elements that qualify.
    """
    filtered_results = []
    
    # Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the unfiltered array
    for element in unfiltered_array:
        # Check if the current element qualifies
        if is_qualified(element):
            # If it qualifies, append it to the results list
            filtered_results.append(element)
    
    return filtered_results  # Return the filtered results
Explanation:
Function Definition:
The function filter_array is defined in Python. The naming convention uses snake_case, which is standard in Python.
Docstring:
A docstring describes the function, its parameters, and its return value, similar to the comments in the JavaScript code.
Initialization:
filtered_results is initialized as an empty list to store the qualifying elements.
Looping through the Array:
Instead of using an index to access elements, the Python for loop directly iterates through each element in unfiltered_array.
Checking Qualification:
The qualification check is done using the passed-in function is_qualified, just as in the JavaScript version.
Appending to Results:
If an element qualifies, it is appended to the filtered_results list.
Return Statement:
The function returns the list of filtered results, similar to how it returns the array in JavaScript.
This Python code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original JavaScript code, allowing it to filter elements based on a given qualification function.
