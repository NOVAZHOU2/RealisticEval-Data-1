Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code with the same functionality and comments:

```python
def filter_array(unfiltered_array, is_qualified):
    """
    Filters elements from a list based on a qualification function.

    :param unfiltered_array: The list to filter.
    :type unfiltered_array: list

    :param is_qualified: The function that determines if an element qualifies.
    :type is_qualified: function

    :return: A new list containing the elements that qualify.
    :rtype: list
    """
```

This Python function `filter_array` takes two parameters:
1. `unfiltered_array`: The list of elements to be filtered.
2. `is_qualified`: A function that determines whether an element should be included in the result.

The function returns a new list containing only those elements for which `is_qualified` returns `True`.
