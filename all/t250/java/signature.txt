Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code signature for your Python function:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Invert the keys and values in a dictionary. If multiple keys have the same value,
 * the new dictionary's values will be a list of these keys.
 *
 * @param originalDict The dictionary to invert.
 * @return A new dictionary with values and keys inverted.
 */
public static Map<Object, Object> invertDictionary(Map<Object, Object> originalDict) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method `invertDictionary` takes a `Map<Object, Object>` as an argument and returns another `Map<Object, Object>`. The docstring comments are preserved as Javadoc comments.
