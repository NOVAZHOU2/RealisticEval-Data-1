Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
import { RegExpExecArray } from "typescript";

/**
 * Extracts a numeric value from the input string based on the given regex pattern.
 *
 * @param x - The input from which to extract the value. It will be converted to a string.
 * @param pattern - The regular expression pattern to use for matching.
 * @returns The extracted weight value if a match is found, otherwise an empty string.
 */
function cleanPattern(x: string | any, pattern: string): string | number {
```

In TypeScript, we don't have `Union` type like in Python. Instead, we use union types with the pipe symbol (`|`). Also, we don't need to specify the `typing` module since it doesn't exist in TypeScript. Instead, TypeScript has built-in support for most common types including `string`, `number`, etc. We also don't need to explicitly convert the input to a string since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and automatically handles this conversion when necessary.
