Sure! Here is the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Sorts an array of objects alphabetically by a specified key.
 *
 * @param {T[]} array - The array of objects to be sorted.
 * @param {string} key - The key in the objects to sort by.
 * @returns {T[]} The sorted array based on the specified key.
 */
function sortByKey<T>(array: T[], key: string): T[] {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version:
- The function `sortByKey` uses a generic type `T` to represent the type of objects in the array.
- The parameter types and return types are annotated with TypeScript types.
- The comments are preserved as they were in the original JavaScript code.

You can then add the implementation inside the function body as needed.
