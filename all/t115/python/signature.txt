To convert the JavaScript function signature you provided into Python, we need to adjust the syntax to fit Python's conventions. Here's how the JavaScript code signature translates into Python:
JavaScript Code Signature
javascript
/**
 * Sorts an array of objects alphabetically by a specified key.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} array - The array of objects to be sorted.
 * @param {string} key - The key in the objects to sort by.
 * @returns {Object[]} The sorted array based on the specified key.
 */
function sortByKey(array, key) {}
Python Equivalent
In Python, we typically use type hints to provide similar information about function parameters and return types. Here's the equivalent Python code signature:
python
from typing import List, Dict

def sort_by_key(array: List[Dict], key: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Sorts a list of dictionaries alphabetically by a specified key.

    :param array: The list of dictionaries to be sorted.
    :param key: The key in the dictionaries to sort by.
    :return: The sorted list based on the specified key.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes
Type Annotations:
List[Dict] is used to specify that array is a list of dictionaries.
str specifies that key is a string.
The return type is specified as List[Dict].
Function Definition:
The function name is converted to snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
Docstring:
A docstring is provided to describe the function, similar to the JavaScript comment block but formatted according to Python conventions.
Implementation Placeholder:
A pass statement is used as a placeholder for the function implementation.
