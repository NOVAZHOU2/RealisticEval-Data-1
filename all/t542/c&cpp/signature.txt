Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.
 *
 * @param originalPrice - The original price of the item.
 * @param actualPrice - The actual price paid for the item.
 * @return The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
 */
double calculateDiscount(double originalPrice, double actualPrice);
```

This function signature in C++ uses `double` instead of `number` for floating-point numbers, which is more common in C++. The return type is also specified as `double`.
