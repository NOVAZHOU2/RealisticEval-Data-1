Here is the equivalent Java code:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.
 *
 * @param originalPrice The original price of the item.
 * @param actualPrice The actual price paid for the item.
 * @return The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
 */
public double calculateDiscount(double originalPrice, double actualPrice) {
    // Calculate the difference between original price and actual price
    double priceDifference = originalPrice - actualPrice;
    
    // Calculate the discount percentage
    double discountPercentage = (priceDifference / originalPrice) * 100;

    // Round off the result to two decimal places
    return Math.round(discountPercentage * 100.0) / 100.0;
}
```

This function takes in the original price and the actual price paid as parameters, calculates the difference, then computes the discount percentage based on that difference relative to the original price. It finally rounds the result to two decimal places before returning it.

Please note that you may need to adjust this function according to your specific requirements or context, such as handling negative input values or different rounding methods.
