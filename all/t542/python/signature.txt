Certainly! Below is the Python version of the JavaScript function with the same functionality and comments:

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price: float, actual_price: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.

    :param original_price: The original price of the item.
    :type original_price: float
    :param actual_price: The actual price paid for the item.
    :type actual_price: float
    :return: The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
    :rtype: float
    """
    # Calculate the difference between the original price and the actual price
    price_difference = original_price - actual_price
    
    # Calculate the discount percentage
    if original_price == 0:
        return 0
    discount_percentage = (price_difference / original_price) * 100
    
    # Round the discount percentage to two decimal places
    return round(discount_percentage, 2)
```

This Python function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters, `original_price` and `actual_price`, and returns the discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places. It includes type hints for better readability and understanding.
