Sure! Below is the Python code signature with the same comments:

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price: float, actual_price: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.

    :param original_price: The original price of the item.
    :type original_price: float

    :param actual_price: The actual price paid for the item.
    :type actual_price: float

    :return: The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
    :rtype: float
    """
```

This function signature in Python uses type hints to specify the types of the parameters and return value, which helps with readability and ensures that the function is used correctly.
