Sure! Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function:

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, actual_price):
    """
    Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.

    :param original_price: The original price of the item.
    :param actual_price: The actual price paid for the item.
    :return: The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
    """
    if original_price == 0:
        return 0
    
    discount = (original_price - actual_price) / original_price * 100
    return round(discount, 2)
```

This Python function takes two parameters (`original_price` and `actual_price`) and calculates the discount percentage. It then returns the result rounded to two decimal places. If the original price is zero, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero errors.
