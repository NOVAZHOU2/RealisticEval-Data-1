Sure! Here's how you can convert the JavaScript function to Python:

```python
def calculate_discount(original_price, actual_price):
    """
    Calculates the discount percentage based on the given price and the actual price paid.

    :param original_price: The original price of the item.
    :type original_price: float or int
    :param actual_price: The actual price paid for the item.
    :type actual_price: float or int
    :return: The discount percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
    :rtype: float
    """
    if original_price == 0:
        return 0

    discount = (original_price - actual_price) / original_price
    discount_percentage = discount * 100
    return round(discount_percentage, 2)
```

This Python function does the same thing as your JavaScript function. It calculates the discount percentage based on the original price and the actual price paid, rounding the result to two decimal places.
