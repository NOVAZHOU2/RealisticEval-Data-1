Here is the equivalent JavaScript function for your Python function:

```javascript
function canClassToDict(obj) {
    /*
     * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
     *
     * @param {any} obj - any type
     * @return {boolean} can obj to dict
     */
    
    return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null;
}
```

This JavaScript function checks if an object is not `null` and its type is `object`. In JavaScript, everything is an object except primitive data types like string, number, boolean, etc. So, we can treat all objects as dictionaries in the same way that Python does.
