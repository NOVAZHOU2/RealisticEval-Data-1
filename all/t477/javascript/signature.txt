Certainly! I’ll convert the Python function signature and comments into equivalent JavaScript syntax, ensuring that the purpose and structure are preserved and the comments are formatted using JSDoc standards.

Here’s the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
/**
 * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
 *
 * @param {any} obj - any type
 * @returns {boolean} - whether the object can be treated as a dictionary
 */
function canClassToDict(obj) {
    // Assuming a simple check based on the object's properties.
    // For demonstration purposes, we check if the object has a '__dict__' property.
    return (
        obj.hasOwnProperty('__dataclass') ||
        (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && obj.constructor === Function.prototype) ||
        (obj && typeof obj === 'object' && obj.__dict__)
    );
}

// Example usage
const exampleObj = {
    __dataclass: true,
    __dict__: { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' }
};

console.log(canClassToDict(exampleObj));  // Should return true
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `can_class_to_dict` is converted to `canClassToDict` in camelCase notation, which is a common convention in JavaScript.
   - The parameter `obj` is kept as `any`, and the return type is `boolean`.

2. **JSDoc Comments**:
   - The Python docstring is converted to JSDoc comments.
   - The `@param` tag specifies the parameter type and description.
   - The `@returns` tag specifies the return type and description.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function body checks if the object has a `__dataclass` property, is a constructor (assuming it behaves like a class), or has a `__dict__` property.
   - The `hasOwnProperty` method is used to check if the object has the `__dataclass` property.
   - The `typeof` operator and `constructor` check are used to determine if the object is a constructor.
   - The `__dict__` property check is included to simulate dictionary-like behavior.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - An example object `exampleObj` is created with the necessary properties to demonstrate the function’s behavior.
   - The `console.log` statement prints the result of calling `canClassToDict` with `exampleObj`.

This conversion ensures that the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code are preserved while adhering to JavaScript conventions and documentation standards.
