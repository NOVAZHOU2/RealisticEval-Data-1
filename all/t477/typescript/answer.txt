Sure, here is how you might translate that Python function into TypeScript:

```typescript
function canClassToDict(obj: any): boolean {
    /**
     * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
     *
     * @param {any} obj - any type
     * @returns {boolean} can obj to dict
     */
    
    return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null;
}
```

In TypeScript, `any` type is equivalent to `Any` in Python, and `typeof` operator checks the type of the variable. The condition `obj !== null` ensures that we're not treating `null` as an object.
