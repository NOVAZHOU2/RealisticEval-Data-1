Sure! Here is the TypeScript equivalent of your Python function with the same signature and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
 *
 * @param obj - any type
 * @returns true if obj can be treated as a dictionary, false otherwise
 */
function canClassToDict(obj: any): boolean {
    // Function implementation would go here
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `any` for parameters that can accept any type, and `boolean` for return values that are either `true` or `false`. The comment above the function follows JSDoc format, which is commonly used in TypeScript to provide documentation for functions.
