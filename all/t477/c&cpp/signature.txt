Certainly! I will convert the given Python function into its equivalent C++ version, ensuring that the functionality, structure, and documentation are preserved.

Here is the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <typeinfo>

// Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
// 
// Args:
//     obj: any type
// 
// Returns:
//     bool: can obj to dict
bool can_class_to_dict(const void* obj) {
    // Simplified assumption: all objects can be treated as having a __dict__ attribute.
    // In C++, we would typically need to know the specific type to perform a more detailed check.
    return true; // Simplified assumption
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    // Assuming MyClass is a class with a __dict__ attribute.
    // MyClass obj;
    // bool result = can_class_to_dict(&obj);
    // std::cout << std::boolalpha << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The Python function `can_class_to_dict` is translated to a C++ function with the same name and return type (`bool`).
   - The argument type `Any` in Python is translated to `const void*` in C++, which allows passing any object as a pointer.

2. **Comments and Docstring**:
   - The Python docstring is converted to C++ comments using `/* ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single-line comments.

3. **Implementation**:
   - In the Python code, the function checks if the object is a dataclass, a type, or has a `__dict__` attribute.
   - In C++, we make a simplified assumption that all objects can be treated as having a `__dict__` attribute. This is because C++ does not have a direct equivalent for Python's dynamic attributes.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - The `main` function provides an example usage of `can_class_to_dict`. You can replace `MyClass` with your specific class or struct to test the function.

If you have additional requirements or specific types you want to check, please provide more details, and I can refine the implementation further.
