Here is the equivalent C++ function signature using `std::any` and `std::function`:

```cpp
#include <any>
#include <functional>

/**
 * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
 *
 * @param obj any type
 * @return true if obj can be converted to dict, false otherwise
 */
bool canClassToDict(const std::any& obj);
```

This function takes an argument of type `std::any`, which allows it to accept any type of object in C++. The return type is `bool`, indicating whether or not the object can be treated as a dictionary. Note that C++ does not have built-in support for dictionaries like Python, so you would need to implement your own logic to determine if the object should be considered a dictionary.
