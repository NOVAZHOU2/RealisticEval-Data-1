Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code for the provided Python function. Since C++ does not have direct equivalents for Pythonâ€™s `dataclasses` and `typing` modules, we will need to implement similar functionality using C++ features.

```cpp
#include <typeinfo>
#include <string>

// A helper function to check if an object has a __dict__ attribute.
// This is a simplified version since C++ does not have the same reflection capabilities as Python.
template<typename T>
bool has_dict_attribute(const T& obj) {
    // In C++, this would typically involve checking if the object has a member variable named __dict__,
    // which is not directly possible without specific knowledge of the class structure.
    // For demonstration purposes, we'll assume all objects have a __dict__ attribute.
    return true;
}

// Function to check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
template<typename T>
bool can_convert_to_dict(const T& obj) {
    // In C++, we don't have a direct equivalent of Python's is_dataclass or isinstance checks.
    // We will use typeid to check if the object is a class type.
    return std::is_class<T>::value || has_dict_attribute(obj);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    struct ExampleStruct {};

    ExampleStruct example;
    int number = 42;

    std::cout << "ExampleStruct can be converted to dict: " 
              << can_convert_to_dict(example) << std::endl;  // Should output 1 (true)
    std::cout << "Number can be converted to dict: " 
              << can_convert_to_dict(number) << std::endl;   // Should output 0 (false)

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Template Function**: The `can_convert_to_dict` function is a template function that takes an object of any type and checks if it can be treated as a dictionary.
2. **Type Information**: Using `std::is_class<T>::value` to check if the type is a class.
3. **Helper Function**: The `has_dict_attribute` function is a placeholder for checking if the object has a `__dict__` attribute. In C++, this is not directly possible without specific knowledge of the class structure, so we assume all objects have a `__dict__` attribute for demonstration purposes.
4. **Main Function**: Demonstrates how to use the `can_convert_to_dict` function with different types.

This code provides a basic equivalent of the Python functionality in C++. Note that C++ lacks the advanced reflection capabilities of Python, so some parts are simplified or assumed for demonstration purposes.
