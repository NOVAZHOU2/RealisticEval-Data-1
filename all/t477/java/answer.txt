Here's how you could convert that Python code into Java:

```java
package org.real.temp;

public class Answer {

    /**
     * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
     *
     * @param obj any type
     * @return true if obj can be converted to a dictionary, false otherwise
     */
    public static boolean canClassToDict(Object obj) {
        // Your logic here
        return obj instanceof Map;
    }
}
```

Please note that in Java there isn't an exact equivalent of Python's `typing.Any`. We're assuming that `Object` will cover all types. Also, we're using `instanceof` operator to check whether the object is an instance of `Map`, which would represent a dictionary in Java. If your actual use case is different, please adjust the method accordingly.
