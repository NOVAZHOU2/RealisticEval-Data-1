Here is the equivalent Java code signature with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Check if the given object can be treated as a dictionary.
 *
 * @param obj any type
 * @return true if obj can be converted to a dictionary, false otherwise
 */
public boolean canClassToDict(Object obj) {
```

This Java method has the same functionality and comments as your Python function. The `Object` class in Java is similar to `Any` in Python, and the return type `boolean` matches the original Python function's return type.
