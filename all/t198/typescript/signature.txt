Hereâ€™s the TypeScript equivalent of the provided C++ function signature, with comments converted to TypeScript style and type declarations adapted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Finds the maximum difference between elements in the array
 * such that the smaller element appears before the larger one.
 *
 * @param l An array of integers containing the elements.
 * @return The maximum difference.
 */
function findMaxDifference(l: number[]): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Signature**: The C++ `int findMaxDifference(const vector<int> &l)` is translated to `function findMaxDifference(l: number[]): number`.
2. **Array Declaration**: The C++ vector is replaced with a TypeScript array type `number[]`.
3. **Return Type**: The return type remains `number`, corresponding to the original C++ `int`.
4. **Comment Syntax**: C++ comments have been changed to TypeScript-style comments.
