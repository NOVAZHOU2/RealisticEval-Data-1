Here’s the equivalent Python code signature with the C++ comments converted to Python style comments, maintaining the same content and structure:
python
def find_max_difference(l):
    """
    Finds the maximum difference between elements in the array 
    such that the smaller element appears before the larger one.

    :param l: A list of integers containing the elements.
    :return: The maximum difference.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Changes Made:
Function Name: Changed from findMaxDifference to find_max_difference to follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter: Changed from const vector<int> &l to l, which is a list in Python. There’s no need for the const keyword or type declaration in Python.
Docstring: The comments are converted to a Python docstring format using triple quotes """ for the function description, parameter, and return value.
Function Body: Added a pass statement to indicate that the function is not yet implemented.
You can replace the pass statement with the actual implementation when needed.
