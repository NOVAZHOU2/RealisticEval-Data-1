Hereâ€™s the equivalent Java function signature based on the provided C++ code, preserving the original functionality and structure:

```java
/**
 * @brief Finds the maximum difference between elements in the array
 * such that the smaller element appears before the larger one.
 *
 * @param l A list of integers containing the elements.
 * @return The maximum difference.
 */
public static int findMaxDifference(List<Integer> l) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Access Modifier**: Added `public static` to the method signature.
2. **Type Conversion**: Changed `vector<int>` to `List<Integer>`.
3. **Comment Style**: Converted C++ comments to Java-style Javadoc comments, preserving the original content.
4. **Curly Braces**: Added a placeholder for the method body with a comment indicating where the implementation would go. 

This Java method signature maintains the intent and structure of the original C++ function.
