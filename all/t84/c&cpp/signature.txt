Sure, here is the C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

/**
 * Finds the smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *
 * @param source The source string in which to search for the window.
 * @param target The target string containing the characters to be matched.
 * @return The smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *         Returns an empty string if no such window exists.
 */
std::string findMinWindowSubstring(const std::string& source, const std::string& target);
```

This C++ function signature uses `std::unordered_map` to keep track of character counts and `std::string` for the input and output strings. The function returns an empty string if no valid window is found, similar to the Python function.
