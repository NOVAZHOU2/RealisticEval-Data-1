Here is how you can convert your Python unittest test class into a Jest test case:

```javascript
const findMinWindowSubstring = require('./find-min-window-substring'); // Adjust the path accordingly

describe('findMinWindowSubstring', () => {
  it('should return the smallest window substring containing all characters of the target string', () => {
    expect(findMinWindowSubstring("ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC")).toBe("BANC");
    expect(findMinWindowSubstring("a", "aa")).toBe("");
    expect(findMinWindowSubstring("bbaac", "abc")).toBe("bbaac");
  });
});
```

This JavaScript test case uses Jest's `describe` and `it` functions to group tests and define individual tests respectively. The `expect` function is used to assert the expected outcome of the `findMinWindowSubstring` function. Please ensure that you have Jest installed and properly configured in your project before running these tests.
