Sure! Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *
 * @param {string} source - The source string in which to search for the window.
 * @param {string} target - The target string containing the characters to be matched.
 * @returns {string|null} - The smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *                          Returns an empty string if no such window exists.
 */
function findMinWindowSubstring(source, target) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript version maintains the same structure and comments as the original Python function.
