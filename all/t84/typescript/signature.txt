```typescript
import { Counter } from 'typescript-collections';

/**
 * Finds the smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *
 * @param source - The source string in which to search for the window.
 * @param target - The target string containing the characters to be matched.
 * @returns The smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
 *          Returns an empty string if no such window exists.
 */
function findMinWindowSubstring(source: string, target: string): string {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Please note that TypeScript does not have built-in support for Python's `collections.Counter`, so you would need to install a package like `typescript-collections` or implement your own counter logic. Also, TypeScript doesn't have an exact equivalent to Python's `Optional` type, but you can use union types (`|`) to achieve similar functionality.
