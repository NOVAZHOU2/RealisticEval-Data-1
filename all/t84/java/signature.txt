Here is the equivalent Java code signature:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Finds the smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
     *
     * @param source The source string in which to search for the window.
     * @param target The target string containing the characters to be matched.
     * @return The smallest window in the source string that contains all characters of the target string.
     *         Returns an empty string if no such window exists.
     */
    public static String findMinWindowSubstring(String source, String target) {
        // Your implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the method `findMinWindowSubstring` would need to be written separately in Java.
