Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Converts an image to a binary representation. Convert the image to black and white mode, 
 * that is, each pixel is represented by only 1 bit, with a white pixel value of 255 and a black pixel value of 0.
 *
 * @param image_path - The file path of the image to convert.
 * @returns An array of bits representing the image, where 1 is for white pixels and 0 is for black pixels.
 */
function convertImageToBits(imagePath: string): number[] {
    // Function implementation goes here...
}
```

### Explanation:
- **TypeScript** uses `number[]` to represent arrays, which corresponds to the `list` in Python.
- The type annotations (`string`, `number[]`) follow the parameter names, similar to Python's docstring format.
- The docstring comment (`/** ... */`) is used in TypeScript to document functions, classes, interfaces, etc., just like Python's triple-quote strings.
