Sure! Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript code, including the necessary type definitions and logic adjustments:

```typescript
import * as math from 'mathjs';

/**
 * Given a 3x3 matrix, return the corresponding translation vector.
 *
 * @param matrix - A 3x3 affine transformation matrix.
 * @returns A 2-element array containing the translation components (translation_x, translation_y).
 */
function getTranslation(matrix: number[][]): number[] {
  // Ensure the matrix is a 3x3 array
  if (!Array.isArray(matrix) || matrix.length !== 3 || matrix.some(row => row.length !== 3)) {
    throw new Error("Input must be a 3x3 affine transformation matrix.");
  }

  // Extract the translation components from the matrix
  const translation: number[] = [matrix[0][2], matrix[1][2]];

  return translation;
}

// Example usage
const matrix: number[][] = [
  [1, 0, 5],
  [0, 1, 3],
  [0, 0, 1]
];

console.log(getTranslation(matrix)); // Output: [5, 3]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `mathjs`**: Since TypeScript does not have a built-in equivalent to NumPy, we use `mathjs` which provides similar functionalities. However, for this specific case, we don't need advanced math operations, so plain JavaScript arrays are sufficient.

2. **Type Definitions**:
   - The input matrix is defined as `number[][]`, which represents a 2D array of numbers.
   - The output is a 2-element array of numbers (`number[]`).

3. **Validation**:
   - We check if the input matrix is a 3x3 array using `Array.isArray` and `.some`.

4. **Extracting Translation Components**:
   - We extract the translation components by accessing the third column of the first two rows.

5. **Return Type**:
   - The function returns the translation components directly as a JavaScript array of numbers. There is no need to explicitly cast to `float64` since TypeScript handles numeric values natively.

This conversion maintains the functionality and logic of the original Python code while adapting it to TypeScript's syntax and conventions.
