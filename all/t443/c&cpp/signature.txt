Here is the equivalent C++ function signature and comments based on the provided Python code:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Compress multiple consecutive whitespace characters in a string into a single space.
 *
 * @param input_string The string to be processed.
 * @return The processed string with compressed whitespace.
 */
std::string compress_whitespace(const std::string& input_string) {
    // Function body would go here
}
```

In this C++ version, I've used `std::string` for string handling, which is a common practice in C++. The docstring has been converted into a block comment that describes the function, its arguments, and return value according to C++ documentation conventions.
