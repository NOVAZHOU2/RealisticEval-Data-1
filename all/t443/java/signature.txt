Here is the Java equivalent of your Python function:

```java
/**
 * Compresses multiple consecutive whitespace characters in a string into a single space.
 *
 * @param inputString The string to be processed.
 * @return The processed string with compressed whitespace.
 */
public static String compressWhitespace(String inputString) {
```

Please note that Java does not have type hints like Python. Instead, it uses the `String` class for strings and `void` for return types (if nothing is returned). Also, Java uses Javadoc style comments (`/** ... */`) instead of triple double quotes for documentation.
