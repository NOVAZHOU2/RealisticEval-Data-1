Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript URL validation function. This implementation uses Python's re module for regular expressions.
Python Code
python
import re

def valid_url(url: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates a URL string using a simplified and more comprehensive regular expression.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL string to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the URL is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Simplified and robust regex for URL validation
    pattern = re.compile(
        r'^(http|https?:\/\/)?' +  # protocol
        r'((([a-zA-Z\d]([a-zA-Z\d-]*[a-zA-Z\d])*)\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}|' +  # domain name and extension
        r'((\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}))' +  # OR IP (v4) address
        r'(:\d+)?' +  # port
        r'(\/[-a-zA-Z\d%_.~+]*)*' +  # path
        r'(\?[;&a-zA-Z\d%_.~+=-]*)?' +  # query string
        r'(\#[-a-zA-Z\d_]*)?$',  # fragment locator
        re.IGNORECASE  # case insensitive matching
    )

    return bool(pattern.match(url))

# Example usage
print(valid_url("http://example.com"))  # True
print(valid_url("https://192.168.1.1"))  # True
print(valid_url("ftp://example.com"))  # False
Explanation of the Conversion:
Function Declaration: The JavaScript function validURL is translated into a Python function named valid_url. The parameter type is annotated with str, and the return type is annotated with bool.
Regular Expression: The JavaScript regular expression string is converted into a raw string (r'') in Python. This ensures that backslashes are treated literally and avoids the need to double them.
Regex Compilation: The re.compile() method is used to compile the regular expression, similar to how new RegExp() is used in JavaScript.
Regex Flags: The flag for case insensitivity in Python is set using re.IGNORECASE when compiling the pattern.
Matching: The pattern.match(url) method is used to check if the provided URL string matches the regular expression. The result is converted to a boolean using bool() to return True or False.
Example Usage: I included example usage at the end to demonstrate how to call the function and check its validity with different URLs.
This Python implementation closely follows the structure and functionality of the original JavaScript code while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
