Hereâ€™s the conversion of the provided C++ function signature and comments into TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Find all prime numbers that are less than or equal to limit using the Eichler sieve algorithm
 *
 * @param limit The upper bound (inclusive) for finding prime numbers.
 * @return An array of integers containing all prime numbers less than or equal to the limit.
 * @throws Error if the limit is less than 2.
 */
function generatePrimes(limit: number): number[] {
    
}
```

In this conversion, I've adjusted the type declarations and memory management conventions to match TypeScript. If you have more specific signatures or classes you'd like to convert, feel free to share!
