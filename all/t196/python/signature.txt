Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature converted to a Python function signature while keeping the code comments and changing them to Python style comments:
C++ Code
cpp
/**
 * @brief Find all prime numbers that are less than or equal to limit using the Eichler sieve algorithm
 *
 * @param limit The upper bound (inclusive) for finding prime numbers.
 * @return A vector of integers containing all prime numbers less than or equal to the limit.
 * @throws std::invalid_argument if the limit is less than 2.
 */
std::vector<int> generatePrimes(int limit) {
Python Code
python
def generate_primes(limit: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Find all prime numbers that are less than or equal to limit using the Eichler sieve algorithm.

    :param limit: The upper bound (inclusive) for finding prime numbers.
    :return: A list of integers containing all prime numbers less than or equal to the limit.
    :raises ValueError: If the limit is less than 2.
    """
Changes Made:
Function Signature:
Changed std::vector<int> generatePrimes(int limit) to def generate_primes(limit: int) -> list[int]:.
Used Python's list type for the return type and added type hints.
Comments:
Converted the C++ comments to a Python docstring format using triple quotes (""") for the function description and parameter details.
Replaced the C++ @throws std::invalid_argument with :raises ValueError in the docstring to reflect the exception type in Python.
This maintains the documentation's clarity while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions. If you have any further requests or questions, feel free to ask!
