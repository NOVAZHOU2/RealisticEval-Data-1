Certainly! Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python function, including appropriate Javadoc comments and Java conventions:

```java
package org.real.temp;

/**
 * Prints the status of each bit (0 or 1) in the given section of memory.
 * 
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     Input: 0b10101010
 *     Output: 10101010
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If there are multiple bytes, they are separated by a newline.
 * 
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     Input: [0b11001100, 0b11110000]
 *     Output: 11001100
 *             11110000
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @param memorySection A byte array representing the section of memory to be read.

    /**
     * Prints the status of each bit (0 or 1) in the given section of memory.
     *
     * @param memorySection A byte array representing the section of memory to be read.
     */
    public static void printMemoryBits(byte[] memorySection) {
        for (byte b : memorySection) {
            for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
                int bit = (b >> i) & 1;
                System.out.print(bit);
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after printing all bits of a byte
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        byte[] memorySection = new byte[]{(byte) 0xAA, (byte) 0x55};
        printMemoryBits(memorySection);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Javadoc Comments**: The Javadoc comments provide a detailed explanation of the method, including examples and parameter descriptions.
2. **Method Signature**: The method `printMemoryBits` takes a `byte[]` array as its parameter.
3. **Looping Through Bytes**: The outer loop iterates through each byte in the `memorySection`.
4. **Bit Extraction**: For each byte, the inner loop extracts each bit using bitwise operations and prints it.
5. **Printing**: After printing all bits of a byte, a newline character is printed to move to the next line for the next byte.
6. **Main Method**: An example usage of the `printMemoryBits` method is included in the `main` method.

This Java code preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python code while adhering to Java conventions and best practices.
