Certainly! Here is the equivalent C++ code that preserves the original purpose and structure of the Python code, including comments and documentation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

/**
 * Prints the status of each bit (0 or 1) in the given section of memory.
 * For example:
 *     input: 0b10101010
 *     output: 10101010
 * If there are multiple bytes, they are split using \n.
 * For example:
 *     input: [0b11001100, 0b11110000]
 *     output: 11001100
 *            11110000
 *
 * @param memory_section A vector of uint8_t representing the section of memory to be read.
 */
void print_memory_bits(const std::vector<uint8_t>& memory_section) {
    for (uint8_t byte : memory_section) {
        for (int i = 7; i >= 0; --i) {
            uint8_t bit = (byte >> i) & 1;
            std::cout << bit;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<uint8_t> memory_section = {0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80};
    print_memory_bits(memory_section);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Header Files**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: For input/output operations.
   - `#include <vector>`: To use `std::vector` for handling dynamic arrays.
   - `#include <bitset>`: Although not directly used here, it can be useful for bit manipulation if needed.

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - The function `print_memory_bits` is documented using C++ style comments (`/** ... */`) to explain the purpose, examples, and parameters.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - `print_memory_bits`: This function takes a `std::vector<uint8_t>` as input, which represents the section of memory to be read.
   - The function iterates over each byte in the vector and prints the bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).

4. **Bit Extraction**:
   - `(byte >> i) & 1`: This expression shifts the byte by `i` positions to the right and then performs a bitwise AND with `1` to extract the bit at position `i`.

5. **Printing Bits**:
   - `std::cout << bit;`: Prints each bit.
   - `std::cout << std::endl;`: Moves to the next line after printing all bits of a byte.

6. **Example Usage**:
   - In the `main` function, an example `memory_section` is defined and passed to `print_memory_bits` to demonstrate its usage.

This C++ code should provide the same functionality as the original Python code, printing the bits of each byte in the memory section, along with appropriate documentation.
