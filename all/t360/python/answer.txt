Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function, with the comments adapted to Python-style comments.
Python Code
python
def get_last_part_of_filepath(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Extracts the last part of a complete file path with the help of a separator and returns it,
    or the original string if no separator is found.

    This function extracts the last part of a file path after the last occurrence of the specified
    separator. If the separator is not found in the path, the function returns the original string.

    :param file_path: The complete file path as a string.
    :return: The last part of the file path after the last separator, or the original string if no separator is found.
    """
    pos = max(file_path.rfind('/'), file_path.rfind('\\'))  # Find last occurrence of '/' or '\'
    if pos == -1:  # If no separator found
        return file_path  # Return the original string if no separator is found
    return file_path[pos + 1:]  # Return the substring after the last separator
Key Components:
Function Definition:
The function is defined as get_last_part_of_filepath which takes a single argument, file_path, of type str and returns a str.
Docstring:
The C++ comments have been converted into a Python docstring format, explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.
Finding the Last Separator:
The method rfind is used to find the last occurrence of the separators ('/' and '\\'). It returns -1 if the separator is not found.
Substring Extraction:
If a separator is found, the code returns the substring from the position right after the last separator to the end of the string. If no separator is found, it returns the original file_path.
Usage Example:
You can use this function in your Python code as follows:
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    path = "C:\\Users\\Example\\Documents\\file.txt"
    last_part = get_last_part_of_filepath(path)
    print(last_part)  # Output: file.txt
This will effectively replicate the functionality of the original C++ code in Python.
