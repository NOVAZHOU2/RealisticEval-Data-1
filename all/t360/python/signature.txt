Hereâ€™s how you can convert the given C++ function signature and comments to Python while keeping the comments intact and formatted in Python style.
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def get_last_part_of_filepath(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    * @brief Extracts the last part of a complete file path with the help of a separator and returns it,
    or the original string if no separator is found.

    * @param file_path: The complete file path as a string.
    * @return: The last part of the file path after the last separator, or the original string if no separator is found.
    """
Key Changes:
Function Name:
The function name has been converted from getLastPartOfFilepath to get_last_part_of_filepath to adhere to Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter:
The parameter type hint for file_path is given as str, indicating it should be a string.
Return Type:
The return type hint is also specified as -> str to indicate that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
The C++ comments have been converted to a Python docstring format (triple quotes) while retaining the original content. The @param and @return tags are kept as part of the comments for documentation purposes.
Example Usage:
You can incorporate this function signature into the complete implementation as follows:
python
def get_last_part_of_filepath(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    * @brief Extracts the last part of a complete file path with the help of a separator and returns it,
    or the original string if no separator is found.

    * @param file_path: The complete file path as a string.
    * @return: The last part of the file path after the last separator, or the original string if no separator is found.
    """
    pos = max(file_path.rfind('/'), file_path.rfind('\\'))  # Find last occurrence of '/' or '\'
    if pos == -1:  # If no separator found
        return file_path  # Return the original string if no separator is found
    return file_path[pos + 1:]  # Return the substring after the last separator
This ensures that the function signature and documentation comments are appropriately adapted for Python while maintaining the original intent and clarity of the C++ version.
