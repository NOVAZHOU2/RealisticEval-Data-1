Here's the equivalent JavaScript function signature and comment style for the provided C++ code, adapted to JavaScript conventions:

```javascript
/**
 * @brief Extracts the last part of a complete file path with the help of a separator and returns it,
 * or the original string if no separator is found.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - The complete file path as a string.
 * @return {string} - The last part of the file path after the last separator,
 * or the original string if no separator is found.
 */
function getLastPartOfFilepath(filePath) {
    // Function implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Declaration**: Changed from C++ style to JavaScript function syntax.
2. **Type Annotations**: Used JSDoc to specify parameter and return types.
3. **Comment Style**: Converted C++ comments to JavaScript-style comments while maintaining the original meaning and structure.
4. **Memory Management**: Removed C++-specific memory management considerations, as JavaScript handles memory automatically. 

The function is currently empty, allowing you to implement the logic as needed.
