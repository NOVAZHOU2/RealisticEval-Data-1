Here's the JavaScript version of your Python function with the same docstring:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds and returns the element from the given array that is closest to the specified target value.
 *
 * @param {number} target - The target number to which we want to find the closest element.
 * @param {Array<number>} elements - An array of numerical elements from which the closest element is to be found.
 * @return {number} The element from the array that is closest to the target value.
 */
function findClosestElement(target, elements) {
```

Note: In JavaScript, `typing` like in Python is not available. Also, the type hinting in JavaScript is done using JSDoc comment style.
