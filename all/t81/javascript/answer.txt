Here's how you can translate your Python function into JavaScript:

```javascript
function findClosestElement(target, elements) {
    if (!Array.isArray(elements)) throw new Error('Elements must be an array');
    if (typeof target !== 'number') throw new Error('Target must be a number');

    let closest = null;
    let minDiff = Infinity;

    for(let i=0; i<elements.length; i++) {
        const diff = Math.abs(target - elements[i]);

        if(diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
            closest = elements[i];
        }
    }

    return closest;
}
```

This JavaScript function does exactly what your Python function does. It iterates over each element in the provided array and finds the one with the smallest difference to the target number. This difference is calculated using the `Math.abs` method to ensure it's always positive regardless of whether the target or element is larger. If the current difference is smaller than the minimum difference found so far, then update both the minimum difference and the closest element. Finally, return the closest element.
