Here's how you can convert your Python function into TypeScript:

```typescript
type TargetType = number;
type ElementsType = TargetType[];

function findClosestElement(target: TargetType, elements: ElementsType): TargetType {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, we define interfaces or type aliases for complex types like `TargetType` and `ElementsType`. Then, we declare our function with the appropriate types. Note that TypeScript does not have an exact equivalent to Python's `Union`, but in this case, we're using TypeScript's built-in `number` type, which covers both integers and floats. If you need more specific handling, you could create separate types for integers and floats and use them accordingly.
