To convert the provided Python function into JavaScript, we'll start by defining the equivalent function in JavaScript. Then, we'll write the Jest test cases to ensure that the function behaves as expected. 

Here is the JavaScript function equivalent to `intersect_vertically`:

```javascript
function intersectVertically(rect1, rect2) {
    /**
     * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction.
     *
     * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
     * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
     * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
     *
     * @param {Array} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
     * @param {Array} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
     * @returns {boolean} - True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
     */
    const [x11, y11, x12, y12] = rect1;
    const [x21, y21, x22, y22] = rect2;

    // Check if there is an overlap in the vertical direction
    return !(y12 < y21 || y11 > y22);
}
```

Now let's define the Jest test suite:

```javascript
const intersectVertically = require('./intersectVertically');  // Adjust the path according to your project structure

describe('intersectVertically', () => {
    it('should detect no vertical intersection when rectangles do not overlap vertically', () => {
        const rect1 = [0, 0, 5, 5];
        const rect2 = [6, 0, 10, 10];
        expect(intersectVertically(rect1, rect2)).toBe(false);
    });

    it('should detect vertical intersection when rectangles overlap vertically', () => {
        const rect1 = [0, 0, 5, 5];
        const rect2 = [0, 3, 5, 8];
        expect(intersectVertically(rect1, rect2)).toBe(true);
    });

    it('should detect vertical intersection when one rectangle is inside another vertically', () => {
        const rect1 = [0, 0, 5, 5];
        const rect2 = [0, 1, 5, 4];
        expect(intersectVertically(rect1, rect2)).toBe(true);
    });

    it('should detect no vertical intersection when rectangles are aligned but not overlapping vertically', () => {
        const rect1 = [0, 0, 5, 5];
        const rect2 = [0, 5, 5, 10];
        expect(intersectVertically(rect1, rect2)).toBe(false);
    });
});
```

### Explanation of Conversion:
1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The Python function `intersect_vertically` was translated to a JavaScript function `intersectVertically`.
   - The parameters were converted from tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to arrays `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`.

2. **Jest Test Cases**:
   - Each `unittest.TestCase` method was converted to a `describe` block with individual `it` blocks for each test case.
   - The assertions in `unittest` (`assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc.) were mapped to Jest's `expect` functions (`toBe`, `toEqual`, etc.).

3. **Import Statement**:
   - The JavaScript function is imported at the beginning of the test file. Ensure the path is correct based on your project structure.

This setup ensures that the functionality and logic of the original Python unittest are preserved in the Jest test cases.
