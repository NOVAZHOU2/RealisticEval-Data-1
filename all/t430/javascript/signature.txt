Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JavaScript documentation standards using JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param {Array} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param {Array} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
 */
function intersectVertically(rect1, rect2) {
    return !(rect1[3] < rect2[1] || rect2[3] < rect1[1]);
}
```

This JavaScript function `intersectVertically` maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure as the original Python function. The JSDoc comments provide clear documentation for the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
