Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction
 * 
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array [x1, y1, x2, y2], where:
 * - [x1, y1] are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - [x2, y2] are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * 
 * @param {Array} rect1 The first rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @param {Array} rect2 The second rectangle defined by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
 * @returns {boolean} True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
 */
function intersectVertically(rect1, rect2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note:
- The Python function name `intersect_vertically` has been converted to `intersectVertically` to follow camelCase naming convention which is more common in JavaScript.
- Python tuples have been replaced with JavaScript arrays.
- Python's `def` keyword is replaced with the `function` keyword in JavaScript.
- The Python comment docstring has been transformed into a JSDoc comment block for better compatibility with JavaScript documentation tools.
