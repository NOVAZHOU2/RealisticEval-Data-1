Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to a JavaScript comment:

```javascript
/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an object {x1, y1, x2, y2}, where:
 * - {x1, y1} are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - {x2, y2} are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param {Object} rect1 - The first rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @param {Object} rect2 - The second rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the rectangles intersect vertically, false otherwise.
 */
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments to document functions. The `@param` tag specifies the parameters and their types, while the `@returns` tag indicates the return type of the function.
