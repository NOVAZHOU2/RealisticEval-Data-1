Here's the C++ code signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by a struct Rect, where:
 * - x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - x2 and y2 are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by a Rect structure.
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by a Rect structure.
 *
 * @return true if the rectangles intersect vertically, false otherwise.
 */
bool intersectVertically(const Rect& rect1, const Rect& rect2);
```

Please note that you need to define the `Rect` struct before using it in the function signature. Here's an example definition for the `Rect` struct:

```cpp
struct Rect {
    int x1;
    int y1;
    int x2;
    int y2;
};
```
