Here is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments converted appropriately:

```cpp
#include <tuple>

/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction
 * 
 * Each rectangle is defined by a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), where:
 * - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * @return True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
 */
bool intersect_vertically(std::tuple<int, int, int, int> rect1, std::tuple<int, int, int, int> rect2) {
    // Function body would go here
}
```

In this translation, the Python tuple type is represented by `std::tuple<int, int, int, int>` in C++. The docstring has been converted into a block comment that adheres to common C++ documentation standards.
