Sure, here's the Java version of your Python function with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction.
 *
 * Each rectangle is defined by an array {x1, y1, x2, y2}, where:
 * - {x1, y1} are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - {x2, y2} are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by {x1, y1, x2, y2}.
 * @return true if the rectangles intersect vertically, false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean intersectVertically(int[] rect1, int[] rect2) {
```

This Java method `intersectVertically` takes two integer arrays representing the rectangles and returns a boolean indicating whether they intersect vertically. The comments are preserved from the original Python code.
