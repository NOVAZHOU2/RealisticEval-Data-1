Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature you provided, converted to Python syntax while retaining the comments and adjusting them to Python style:
python
class PriorityQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []  # This will store the elements of the heap

    # Helper function to get the index of the parent
    def parent(self, index):
        pass

    # Helper function to get the index of the left child
    def left_child(self, index):
        pass

    # Helper function to get the index of the right child
    def right_child(self, index):
        pass

    # Helper function to swap two elements in the heap
    def swap(self, a, b):
        pass

    # Heapify up to maintain the max-heap property after insertion
    def heapify_up(self, index):
        pass

    # Heapify down to maintain the max-heap property after deletion
    def heapify_down(self, index):
        pass

    # Insert an element into the priority queue
    def push(self, value):
        pass

    # Remove the maximum element from the priority queue
    def pop(self):
        pass

    # Get the maximum element without removing it
    def top(self):
        pass

    # Check if the priority queue is empty
    def is_empty(self):
        pass

    # Get the size of the priority queue
    def size(self):
        pass
Changes Made:
Converted the class definition and method signatures from C++ to Python syntax.
Changed C++ style comments (//) to Python style comments (#).
Added an __init__ method to initialize the heap list, which is necessary in Python classes.
