To convert the JavaScript code signature and documentation to Python, you would typically use a docstring to describe the function. Hereâ€™s how you can represent the function signature and docstring in Python:
Python Code Signature
python
def generate_unique_pairs(array: list) -> list:
    """
    Generates all unique combinations of pairs from an array.

    :param array: The input list from which combinations are generated.
    :return: A list of lists, where each inner list contains a unique pair of elements.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation:
Function Name:
The JavaScript function generateUniquePairs is converted to generate_unique_pairs following the Python naming convention (PEP 8), which uses snake_case for function names.
Parameter Type Hint:
The parameter array is annotated with the type list to indicate that it expects a list of elements.
Return Type Hint:
The function return type is annotated with -> list to indicate that it returns a list of lists.
Docstring:
A docstring is provided in triple quotes to describe the function, similar to the JavaScript documentation. The docstring includes:
A brief description of the function.
Parameter details with :param.
Return details with :return.
Function Body:
The pass statement is used to indicate that the function is not yet implemented. You would replace this with the actual implementation of the function when you are ready.
This structure provides clear documentation and type hints, making the code easier to understand and maintain in Python.
