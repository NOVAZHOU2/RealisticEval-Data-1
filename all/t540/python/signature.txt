Certainly! Below is the Python version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```python
def generate_unique_pairs(array):
    """
    Generates all unique combinations of pairs from an array.

    :param array: The input array from which combinations are generated.
    :return: A list of lists, where each inner list contains a unique pair of elements.
    """
    # Your implementation goes here
```

This Python function signature and docstring match the structure and purpose of your original JavaScript function.
