Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def generate_unique_pairs(array):
    """
    Generates all unique combinations of pairs from an array.

    :param array: The input array from which combinations are generated.
    :return: A list of lists, where each inner list contains a unique pair of elements.
    """
```

This function does not have any implementation yet because it's not clear what kind of unique pairs you want to generate. If you want to generate all possible pairs (including duplicates), you can use two nested loops. If you want only unique pairs without duplicates, you may need to use a set or a dictionary to keep track of visited pairs. Please provide more details so I can write the correct function for your needs.
