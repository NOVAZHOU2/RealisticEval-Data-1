Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Generates all unique combinations of pairs from a vector.
 *
 * @param array - The input vector from which combinations are generated.
 * @return A vector of vectors, where each inner vector contains a unique pair of elements.
 */
std::vector<std::vector<int>> generateUniquePairs(const std::vector<int>& array);
```

This C++ version uses `std::vector` instead of JavaScript's `Array`, and it assumes that the elements in the array are integers (`int`). If your array can contain different types, you may need to adjust the type accordingly.
