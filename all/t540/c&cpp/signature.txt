Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature that corresponds to the JavaScript code signature you provided, along with the comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Generates all unique combinations of pairs from an array.
 *
 * @param vector<int> array - The input vector from which combinations are generated.
 * @returns vector<vector<int>> - A vector of vectors, where each inner vector contains a unique pair of elements.
 */
vector<vector<int>> generateUniquePairs(const vector<int>& array) {
}
```

### Explanation:
- The parameter is defined as `const vector<int>& array`, indicating that it takes a constant reference to a vector of integers.
- The return type is `vector<vector<int>>`, which matches the expected output of an array of arrays in JavaScript.
