Sure! Here's the Java equivalent of the JavaScript code signature, including the comments:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Generates all unique combinations of pairs from an array.
 *
 * @param array - The input array from which combinations are generated.
 * @returns - A list of lists, where each inner list contains a unique pair of elements.
 */
public List<List<T>> generateUniquePairs(T[] array) {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```

In this signature, I've used generics (`<T>`) to make it flexible for different types of arrays, and `List<List<T>>` instead of `Array` for the return type, which is more idiomatic in Java. Let me know if you need further modifications or the full implementation!
