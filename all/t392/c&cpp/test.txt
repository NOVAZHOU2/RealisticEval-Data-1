To convert the Python unittest test class into a C++ Catch2 test case, you first need to implement the `look_and_say` function in C++. Below is an example of how you can do this:

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

std::string look_and_say(const std::string& number) {
    if (number.empty()) return "";

    std::string result;
    char current = number[0];
    int count = 1;

    for (size_t i = 1; i < number.length(); ++i) {
        if (number[i] == current) {
            ++count;
        } else {
            result += std::to_string(count);
            result += current;
            current = number[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }

    result += std::to_string(count);
    result += current;

    return result;
}
```

### Catch2 Test Case

Now, let's create a Catch2 test case to verify the correctness of the `look_and_say` function.

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch.hpp"

TEST_CASE("Look and Say Sequence", "[look_and_say]") {
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("") == "");
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("1") == "11");
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("11") == "21");
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("21") == "1211");
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("1211") == "111221");
    REQUIRE(look_and_say("111221") == "312211");
    // Add more test cases as needed
}
```

### Explanation

1. **C++ Implementation**:
   - The `look_and_say` function iterates through the input string, counting consecutive digits and appending the count followed by the digit to the result string.

2. **Catch2 Test Case**:
   - We include the Catch2 header and define a test case using `TEST_CASE`.
   - Each `REQUIRE` statement checks if the output of `look_and_say` matches the expected result for a given input.

To run these tests, you need to have Catch2 installed and properly set up in your project. If you're using a build system like CMake, you can add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(Catch2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(tests test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tests Catch2::Catch2_main)
```

Then, you can build and run the tests using your build system. For example, with CMake:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./tests
```

This will execute the Catch2 test cases and report any failures or successes.
