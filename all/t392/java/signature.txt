Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code with the same comments:

```java
/**
 * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
 * grouping by consecutive digits.
 *
 * @param number The current sequence as a string.
 * @return The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
 */
public String lookAndSay(String number) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This Java method signature matches the Python function signature you provided, including the docstring that describes what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
