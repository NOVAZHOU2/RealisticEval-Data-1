Here is the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
 * grouping by consecutive digits.
 * 
 * @param number - The current sequence as a string.
 * @returns The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
 */
function lookAndSay(number: string): string {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

Note that the actual implementation of the function logic would need to be added inside the `lookAndSay` function. The comments and docstring have been converted to TypeScript JSDoc style.
