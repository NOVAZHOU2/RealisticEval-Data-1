Here's the equivalent TypeScript function signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
 * grouping by consecutive digits.
 *
 * @param number - The current sequence as a string.
 * @returns The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
 */
function lookAndSay(number: string): string {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `/// <reference path="..." />` for single-line comments. The type annotations are specified after the parameter names using a colon (`:`) followed by the type name. The return type is specified after the closing parenthesis of the parameters list using an arrow (`->`) followed by the return type.
