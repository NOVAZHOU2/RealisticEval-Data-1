Certainly! Below is the JavaScript version of the provided Python function with the same functionality and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
 * grouping by consecutive digits.
 *
 * @param {string} number - The current sequence as a string.
 * @returns {string} The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
 */
function lookAndSay(number) {
    // Initialize an empty array to store the result
    let result = [];
    
    // Initialize variables to keep track of the count and the previous character
    let count = 1;
    let prevChar = number[0];
    
    // Iterate through the characters starting from the second one
    for (let i = 1; i < number.length; i++) {
        const char = number[i];
        
        // If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the count
        if (char === prevChar) {
            count++;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, push the count and the previous character to the result array
            result.push(count.toString());
            result.push(prevChar);
            
            // Reset the count and update the previous character
            count = 1;
            prevChar = char;
        }
    }
    
    // Push the last group's count and character to the result array
    result.push(count.toString());
    result.push(prevChar);
    
    // Join the result array into a string and return it
    return result.join('');
}
```

This JavaScript function `lookAndSay` takes a string representing the current sequence and returns the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series. The comments explain each part of the function.
