Here's the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
 * grouping by consecutive digits.
 *
 * @param {string} number - The current sequence as a string.
 * @returns {string} The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
 */
function lookAndSay(number) {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

The JSDoc comments preserve the original documentation structure and provide clear information about the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
