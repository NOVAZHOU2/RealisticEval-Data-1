Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function for the provided Python code:

```javascript
function lookAndSay(number) {
    /**
     * Generates the next sequence in the 'look-and-say' sequence by reading off the digits of the given number,
     * grouping by consecutive digits.
     *
     * @param {string} number - The current sequence as a string.
     * @return {string} The next sequence in the 'look-and-say' series.
     */
    
    let result = '';
    let count = 1;
    let prevDigit = number[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < number.length; i++) {
        if (number[i] === prevDigit) {
            count++;
        } else {
            result += count + prevDigit;
            prevDigit = number[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }

    // Add the last group
    result += count + prevDigit;

    return result;
}
```

This JavaScript function works similarly to the Python version. It iterates through the input string, counts consecutive digits, and constructs the next sequence accordingly.
