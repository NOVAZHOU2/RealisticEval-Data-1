Certainly! Here is the equivalent C++ code signature with the same comments and documentation:

```cpp
#include <string>

/**
 * Truncate a string to the specified length, replacing the excess part with an ellipsis.
 *
 * @param str The string to truncate.
 * @param maxLength The maximum length of the resulting string.
 * @return The truncated string with ellipsis if applicable.
 */
std::string truncateStringWithReplacement(const std::string& str, int maxLength) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This C++ code signature includes the same comments and documentation as the original JavaScript function. You can add the implementation inside the function body as needed.
