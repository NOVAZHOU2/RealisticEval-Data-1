Certainly! Here is the Java code signature with the comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Truncate a string to the specified length, replacing the excess part with an ellipsis.
 *
 * @param str The string to truncate.
 * @param maxLength The maximum length of the resulting string.
 * @return The truncated string with ellipsis if applicable.
 */
public static String truncateStringWithReplacement(String str, int maxLength) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

This Java method signature matches the JavaScript function signature in terms of parameters and documentation comments. You can add the implementation inside the method body as needed.
