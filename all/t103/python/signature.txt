To convert the provided JavaScript function signature, including its JSDoc comments, to Python, you can follow the structure of Pythonâ€™s function definition and use type hints for the parameters and return type. Below is how you would represent the same functionality in Python:
JavaScript Signature
javascript
/**
 * Truncate a string to the specified length, replacing the excess part with an ellipsis.
 *
 * @param {string} str - The string to truncate.
 * @param {number} maxLength - The maximum length of the resulting string.
 * @returns {string} - The truncated string with ellipsis if applicable.
 */
function truncateStringWithReplacement(str, maxLength) {}
Converted Python Signature
python
def truncate_string_with_replacement(s: str, max_length: int) -> str:
    """
    Truncate a string to the specified length, replacing the excess part with an ellipsis.

    Args:
        s (str): The string to truncate.
        max_length (int): The maximum length of the resulting string.

    Returns:
        str: The truncated string with ellipsis if applicable.
    """
    pass  # Replace with actual implementation
Explanation of the Python Signature
Function Definition:
The function is defined using def, followed by the function name in snake_case (truncate_string_with_replacement), which is the convention in Python.
Parameters:
s: str: The parameter s is typed as a string, corresponding to str in JavaScript.
max_length: int: The parameter max_length is typed as an integer, corresponding to number in JavaScript.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated by -> str, meaning that the function is expected to return a string.
Docstring:
The docstring uses triple quotes (""") to describe the function, similar to the JSDoc comments in JavaScript. It includes descriptions for the parameters and return value, aligning with Python's conventions.
Placeholder for Implementation:
The pass statement is a placeholder indicating that the function's implementation should be added later.
This structure ensures that the function in Python maintains the intended functionality and documentation style from the JavaScript version.
