Sure, here is the equivalent Java method signature with comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the distance between two points on the Earth based on their latitude and longitude.
 *
 * @param lat1 Latitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lon1 Longitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lat2 Latitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @param lon2 Longitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @return The distance between the two points in kilometers.
 */
public static double haversineDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {
```

This Java method has the same functionality and parameters as your Python function, but it uses `double` instead of `float` for the latitude and longitude values, which is more common in Java for such calculations.
