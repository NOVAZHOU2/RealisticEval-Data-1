Here's how you can convert your Python function signature into TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the distance between two points on the Earth based on their latitude and longitude.
 * 
 * @param lat1 - Latitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lon1 - Longitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lat2 - Latitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @param lon2 - Longitude of the second point in degrees.
 * 
 * @returns The distance between the two points in kilometers.
 */
function haversineDistance(lat1: number, lon1: number, lat2: number, lon2: number): number {
    // Function implementation here...
}
```

In TypeScript, we use `number` instead of `float`, and the type annotations for the parameters and return value follow directly after them, separated by a colon (`:`). We also use JSDoc-style comments for documentation, which is similar to Python's docstrings but formatted differently.
