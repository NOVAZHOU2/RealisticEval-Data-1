Sure, here is the C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate the distance between two points on the Earth based on their latitude and longitude.
 *
 * @param lat1 The latitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lon1 The longitude of the first point in degrees.
 * @param lat2 The latitude of the second point in degrees.
 * @param lon2 The longitude of the second point in degrees.
 * 
 * @return The distance between the two points in kilometers.
 */
double haversineDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2);
```

This function prototype can be used in a C++ program to declare that there will be a function named `haversineDistance` which takes four `double` parameters representing the latitudes and longitudes of two points and returns a `double` value representing the distance between them in kilometers.
