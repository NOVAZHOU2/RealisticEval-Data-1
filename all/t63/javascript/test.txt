Here is the equivalent JavaScript test case using Jest:

```javascript
const { dataFrameToMarkdown } = require('./dataframe-to-markdown');

describe('Dataframe to Markdown conversion', () => {
    it('should convert a DataFrame object to a markdown table', () => {
        const df = {
            Name: ['Alice', 'Bob'],
            Age: [25, 30]
        };

        const mdPath = './output.md';

        expect(dataFrameToMarkdown(df, mdPath)).toBe('| Name | Age |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alice | 25 |\n| Bob | 30 |\n');
    });
});
```

Note that you need to have `jest` and `@types/jest` installed in your project for this to work. Also, replace `'./dataframe-to-markdown'` with the actual path where your function resides. The `expect()` function is used to check if the output of the function matches the expected result.

The `it()` function is used to define an individual test case, which can be run independently of other tests. Each `it()` block should contain a single assertion. If more than one assertion is needed within a test, they should all be contained within a single `it()` block.

The `describe()` function is used to group related test cases together. It helps in organizing the tests into logical groups and makes them easier to read and understand.
