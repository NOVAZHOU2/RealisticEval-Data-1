Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ test case using Catch2 for your Python unittest test class. This assumes you have the `pandas` library available in C++ and that you want to test the `dataframe_to_markdown` function.

First, ensure you have Catch2 installed and set up in your project. You can include it via a header file or install it via a package manager like vcpkg.

Here's how you might write the C++ test case:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <pandas/pandas.h> // Assuming you have a C++ version of pandas available

// Function declaration
std::string dataframe_to_markdown(const pandas::DataFrame& df, const std::string& md_path);

TEST_CASE("Dataframe to Markdown Conversion", "[dataframe_to_markdown]") {
    // Create a sample DataFrame
    pandas::DataFrame df = {{"Name", {"Alice", "Bob"}},
                            {"Age", {25, 30}}};

    // Specify the output MD file path
    std::string md_path = "output.md";

    // Call the function with the sample DataFrame and output path
    std::string result = dataframe_to_markdown(df, md_path);

    // Check if the result matches the expected markdown content
    REQUIRE(result == "| Name | Age |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alice | 25 |\n| Bob | 30 |\n");
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Catch2**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` directive includes the Catch2 testing framework.
2. **Include Pandas**: The `#include <pandas/pandas.h>` directive includes the pandas library for C++. Ensure you have a valid C++ version of pandas available.
3. **Function Declaration**: The `dataframe_to_markdown` function is declared before the test case.
4. **Test Case**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a new test case named "Dataframe to Markdown Conversion".
   - A sample DataFrame is created with names and ages.
   - The output MD file path is specified.
   - The `dataframe_to_markdown` function is called with the sample DataFrame and output path.
   - The result is compared to the expected markdown content using `REQUIRE`.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and environment set up to compile and run this C++ code with Catch2.
