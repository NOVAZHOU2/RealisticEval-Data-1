/**
 * Convert an array of binary bits to an array of bytes. Traverse through each bit,

 * If the length of the bit array is not a multiple of 8, the last incomplete byte will be discarded.
 *
 * @param {number[]} bits - The input array of bits (each element should be 0 or 1).
 * @returns {Uint8Array} An array of bytes constructed from the bits.
