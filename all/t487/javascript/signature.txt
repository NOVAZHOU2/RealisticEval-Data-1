```javascript
/**
 * Check if the given text contains an email address.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The string to search for an email address.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if an email address is found, False otherwise.
 */
function containsEmail(text) {
  // Your JavaScript implementation here
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function in JavaScript would need to be provided based on the original Python code logic. This comment block is just a direct translation of your Python docstring into JavaScript JSDoc format.
