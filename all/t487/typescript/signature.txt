Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Check if the given text contains an email address.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The string to search for an email address.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if an email address is found, False otherwise.
 */
function containsEmail(text: string): boolean {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

If you have any specific implementation details or additional logic that you want to include in the function, feel free to provide those and I can help you further!
