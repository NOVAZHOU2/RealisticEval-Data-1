Here's how you can convert the Python function signature to C++:

```cpp
#include <regex>
#include <string>

/**
 * Check if the given text contains an email address.
 *
 * @param text The string to search for an email address.
 * @return True if an email address is found, False otherwise.
 */
bool containsEmail(const std::string& text);
```

This C++ function signature uses `std::regex` from the `<regex>` header and returns a boolean value indicating whether an email address was found in the input string. The function takes a constant reference to a `std::string` as its parameter.
