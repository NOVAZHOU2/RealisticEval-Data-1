Here's the equivalent Java method with comments:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

/**
 * Checks if the provided text contains an email address.
 *
 * @param text The string to be searched for an email address.
 * @return true if an email address is found, false otherwise.
 */
public static boolean containsEmail(String text) {
```

Note that in Java, we use `static` methods instead of Python functions and return types are explicitly specified. Also, Java uses `//` for single-line comments and `/** ... */` for multi-line comments.
