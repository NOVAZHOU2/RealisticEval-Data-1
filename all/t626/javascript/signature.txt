Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature with JSDoc comments, preserving the purpose and structure of your Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a file from the specified path, processes each line to remove inline comments,
 * removes line breaks, and returns an array of the processed line contents.
 *
 * @param {string} path - The path to the file to be read.
 * @returns {string[]} An array of strings, each representing a processed line from the file.
 */
function readFileAndProcessLines(path) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**: The comments have been rewritten to follow JSDoc standards, detailing the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.
2. **Function Declaration**: The function is defined in JavaScript syntax, omitting the type hints found in Python.
