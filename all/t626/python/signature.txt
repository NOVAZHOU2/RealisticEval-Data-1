To convert the given Java function signature into a Python function signature, we need to take into account Python's syntax and conventions. The equivalent function in Python can be defined using the following points:
Method Naming: In Python, itâ€™s common to use snake_case for function names rather than camelCase.
Type Hints: Python supports type hints, which allow us to specify the expected types for parameters and return values.
Exceptions: Python uses exceptions but does not declare them in the function signature; instead, they are raised when needed.
Here's how the Java function signature can be converted into Python:
python
from typing import List

def read_file_and_process_lines(path: str) -> List[str]:
    pass  # Implementation goes here
Explanation:
def: This keyword defines a new function in Python.
read_file_and_process_lines: The function name is converted to snake_case.
path: str: This indicates that the path parameter is expected to be a string.
-> List[str]: This indicates that the function returns a list of strings.
pass: This is a placeholder statement in Python that does nothing, typically used when the function is not yet implemented.
Additional Notes:
You can implement the file reading and processing logic inside the function where the pass statement is located.
You would handle any I/O exceptions in Python using a try-except block within the function implementation.
