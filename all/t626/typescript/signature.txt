Here's the equivalent TypeScript code:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads a file from the specified path, processes each line to remove inline comments,
 * removes line breaks, and returns a list of the processed line contents.
 *
 * @param path - The path to the file to be read.
 * @returns A list of strings, each representing a processed line from the file.
 */
function readFileAndProcessLines(path: string): string[] {
    const processedLines: string[] = [];
    // Function implementation will go here
    return processedLines;
}
``` 

Feel free to ask if you need further modifications or the implementation details!
