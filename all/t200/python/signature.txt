Here’s the equivalent Python code signature for the provided C++ code, along with the comments converted to Python style.
Python Code Signature
python
def extract_string_from_braces(input: str) -> str:
    """
    Extracts the string contained in the first pair of braces `{}` from the input string.

    :param input: The input string from which the braces content will be extracted.
    :return: A substring enclosed within the first pair of braces, or an error message if braces are missing.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition:
The function name is changed to extract_string_from_braces, following Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
The input parameter type is specified as str, and the return type is specified as str using Python's type hinting.
Docstring:
The C++ comments are converted into a Python docstring, maintaining the original structure and meaning.
Python docstrings use triple quotes """ and the parameter and return type descriptions are formatted using the :param and :return directives.
Function Body:
The body contains a placeholder pass statement to indicate where the implementation would go.
Complete Example
If you want to see the complete code including the function body, here’s how you might structure it:
python
def extract_string_from_braces(input: str) -> str:
    """
    Extracts the string contained in the first pair of braces `{}` from the input string.

    :param input: The input string from which the braces content will be extracted.
    :return: A substring enclosed within the first pair of braces, or an error message if braces are missing.
    """
    # Find the position of the first opening brace
    opening_brace_pos = input.find('{')
    
    # Check if an opening brace was found
    if opening_brace_pos == -1:
        return "No opening brace found."
    
    # Find the position of the first closing brace after the opening brace
    closing_brace_pos = input.find('}', opening_brace_pos)
    
    # Check if a closing brace was found
    if closing_brace_pos == -1:
        return "No closing brace found."
    
    # Extract the string between the braces (including the braces)
    return input[opening_brace_pos:closing_brace_pos + 1]
