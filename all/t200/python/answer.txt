Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ function. The function extracts the substring between the first pair of braces {} from the input string. The C++ comments are retained and adapted to Python style comments.
Python Code
python
def extract_string_from_braces(input):
    # Find the position of the first opening brace
    opening_brace_pos = input.find('{')
    
    # Check if an opening brace was found
    if opening_brace_pos == -1:
        return "No opening brace found."
    
    # Find the position of the first closing brace after the opening brace
    closing_brace_pos = input.find('}', opening_brace_pos)
    
    # Check if a closing brace was found
    if closing_brace_pos == -1:
        return "No closing brace found."
    
    # Extract the string between the braces (including the braces)
    return input[opening_brace_pos:closing_brace_pos + 1]

# Example usage:
input_string = "This is a test string with {content inside braces}."
result = extract_string_from_braces(input_string)
print(result)  # Output: {content inside braces}
Explanation of Changes:
Function Definition: The C++ function extractStringFromBraces is renamed to extract_string_from_braces to follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).
String Methods:
The C++ find method is replaced by the Python find method, which works similarly but returns -1 if the substring is not found.
The C++ substr method is replaced by Python's slicing syntax (input[opening_brace_pos:closing_brace_pos + 1]).
Comments: The comments have been converted to Python-style comments, maintaining the original meanings.
Example Usage: An example usage is added at the bottom to demonstrate how to call the function and print the result.
Testing the Function
You can copy and run this code in any Python environment to test its functionality. Adjust the input_string variable to test different strings containing or not containing braces.
