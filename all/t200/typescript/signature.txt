Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature based on the provided C++ code, including the comments converted to TypeScript style:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Extracts the string contained in the first pair of braces `{}` from the input string.
 *
 * @param input The input string from which the braces content will be extracted.
 * @return A substring enclosed within the first pair of braces, or an error message if braces are missing.
 */
function extractStringFromBraces(input: string): string {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments while adapting to TypeScript conventions. Let me know if you need anything else!
