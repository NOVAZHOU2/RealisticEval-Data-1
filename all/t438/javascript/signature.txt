Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code, including the function signature and comments converted to JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Reads a CSV file and converts it to a pandas DataFrame.
 * 
 * @param {string} file_path - The path to the CSV file.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} A promise that resolves to an object containing the data from the CSV file.
 */
async function readCSVtoDataFrame(file_path) {
    // Assuming the use of a library like PapaParse or similar for CSV parsing
    const parseResult = await Papa.parse(file_path, { download: true, header: true });
    return parseResult.data;
}
```

Please note that in JavaScript, unlike Python's `pandas`, there isn't a direct equivalent for a DataFrame. Instead, we can use libraries such as `PapaParse` for parsing CSV files, and the result is typically an array of objects. The function above uses `PapaParse` to parse the CSV file and returns a Promise that resolves to the parsed data. 

If you need further customization or have other specific requirements, feel free to let me know!
