To convert your Python unittest test class to a C++ test case using Catch2, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Catch2 in your project. If you're using CMake, you can add it as a subdirectory or find it via a package manager like vcpkg.
2. Write your C++ test cases using the Catch2 framework.
3. Ensure that any dependencies like pandas in Python are replaced with appropriate libraries in C++. For CSV reading, you might use `std::ifstream` and other standard library components.

Here's an example of how you might write a similar test case in C++ using Catch2:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

// Assuming you have a function that reads a CSV into a vector of strings for demonstration purposes
std::vector<std::string> readCsv(const std::string& filePath) {
    // Implementation goes here
}

TEST_CASE("Read CSV to Dataframe", "[read_csv]") {
    std::string filePath = "path/to/your/file.csv";
    
    // Call the function to be tested
    auto result = readCsv(filePath);

    // Assert that the result is not empty
    REQUIRE(!result.empty());

    // Add more assertions based on the expected output
}
```

In this example, `readCsv` is a placeholder function that should be implemented to read a CSV file and return its contents as a vector of strings. You would replace this with actual implementation logic similar to what you would do in Python using pandas.

Remember to include the necessary headers and link against the Catch2 library when compiling your C++ code.
