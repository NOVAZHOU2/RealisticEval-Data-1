Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Reads a CSV file and converts it to a pandas DataFrame.
 *
 * @param {string} file_path - The path to the CSV file.
 * @returns {Promise<pd.DataFrame>} - A promise that resolves to a DataFrame containing the data from the CSV file.
 */
async function readCsvToDataFrame(file_path: string): Promise<pd.DataFrame> {
```

Please note that in TypeScript, we typically use `Promise` to handle asynchronous operations. If you're using a library like `pandas-js`, make sure it supports promises for its functions. If not, you might need to use a different approach or implement custom logic to handle the conversion asynchronously.
