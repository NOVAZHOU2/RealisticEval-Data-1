Certainly! Here’s the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function, including the appropriate documentation comments:

```typescript
import * as pandas from 'pandas';

/**
 * Reads a CSV file and converts it to a pandas DataFrame.
 * 
 * @param file_path The path to the CSV file.
 * @returns DataFrame containing the data from the CSV file.
 */
function readCsvToDataFrame(file_path: string): pandas.DataFrame {
    /**
     * Note: In TypeScript, there isn't an exact equivalent of pandas, but assuming a library that provides similar functionality.
     * For demonstration purposes, we'll use a hypothetical 'pandas' library in TypeScript.
     */
    const dataframe = pandas.read_csv(file_path);
    return dataframe;
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Library Import**: In TypeScript, you would need a library that mimics the functionality of pandas. For this example, I used `pandas` as a placeholder, which is not available in TypeScript natively. You might need to use a different library such as `pandas-js` or another equivalent library that supports reading CSV files.
2. **Documentation Comments**: The Python docstring has been converted to TypeScript JSDoc comments.
3. **Type Annotations**: The `str` type annotation in Python is translated to `string` in TypeScript.
4. **Return Type**: The `pd.DataFrame` type is translated to `pandas.DataFrame`. If you’re using a different library, adjust the return type accordingly.

If you have a specific TypeScript library that you want to use for handling CSV files, please let me know, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
