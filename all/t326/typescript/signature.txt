Hereâ€™s the TypeScript code signature with the comments retained:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.
 *
 * @param {Date | string} givenDate - The date to compare against the current date.
 * @returns {Object} - An object containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
 * {
 *         days: number,
 *         hours: number,
 *         minutes: number,
 * }
 */
function calculateTimeDifference(givenDate: Date | string): { days: number; hours: number; minutes: number } {
}
```

This keeps the comments intact while updating the function signature to TypeScript.
