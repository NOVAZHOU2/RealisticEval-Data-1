Here is your JavaScript function converted into TypeScript with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.
 *
 * @param {Date | string} givenDate - The date to compare against the current date.
 * @returns {Object} - An object containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
 * {
 *     days: number;
 *     hours: number;
 *     minutes: number;
 * }
 */
function calculateTimeDifference(givenDate: Date | string): {days: number; hours: number; minutes: number;} {
}
```

Please note that I've added type annotations for the parameters and return value of the `calculateTimeDifference` function in the TypeScript version. This will help catch potential errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
