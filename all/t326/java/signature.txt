Hereâ€™s the Java code signature with comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.
 *
 * @param givenDate - The date to compare against the current date.
 * @returns TimeDifference - An object containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
 */
public static TimeDifference calculateTimeDifference(String givenDate) {
}
```

You can replace `String` with a different type if needed, depending on your input requirements.
