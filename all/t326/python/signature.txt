To convert the provided JavaScript function signature to a Python function signature, we need to consider the following:
Function Name: The function name will remain the same.
Parameter Type: Python does not have built-in types like Date or string, but we can use the str type for strings and the datetime module for date and time manipulations.
Return Type: Python can return dictionaries, which can mimic the object returned in JavaScript.
Here is the equivalent Python code signature for the given JavaScript function:
python
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_time_difference(given_date: str) -> dict:
    """ 
    Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.

    Args:
        given_date (str): The date to compare against the current date.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
              {
                  'days': days,
                  'hours': remaining_hours,
                  'minutes': remaining_minutes,
              }
    """
    pass
Explanation:
Import Statement: The datetime module is imported to work with date and time.
Function Definition: The function is defined using Python's def keyword.
Parameter Type Annotation: The given_date parameter is annotated as a string (str), which is the closest equivalent to a JavaScript string.
Return Type Annotation: The function is annotated to return a dictionary (dict), which is suitable for returning structured data similar to the JavaScript object.
Docstring: The docstring is updated to use Python conventions and includes type hints for clarity.
Implementation Consideration:
In a full implementation, you would parse the given_date string to a datetime object and calculate the difference with the current time, but the provided code is focused solely on the signature. If you need help with the actual implementation, let me know!
