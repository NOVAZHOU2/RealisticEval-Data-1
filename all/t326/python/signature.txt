Sure! Below is the Python version of your JavaScript function with the same comments:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_time_difference(given_date):
    """
    Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.

    :param given_date: The date to compare against the current date. Can be a Date object or a string in ISO format.
    :type given_date: datetime.date or str
    :return: An object containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
    :rtype: dict
    {
        'days': days,
        'hours': remaining_hours,
        'minutes': remaining_minutes,
    }
    """

    # Convert the input date to a datetime object if it's not already one
    if isinstance(given_date, str):
        given_date = datetime.strptime(given_date, "%Y-%m-%d")

    # Get the current date and time
    now = datetime.now()

    # Calculate the difference between the current date and the given date
    time_diff = now - given_date

    # Extract days, hours, and minutes from the time difference
    days = time_diff.days
    remaining_seconds = time_diff.seconds
    remaining_hours = remaining_seconds // 3600
    remaining_minutes = (remaining_seconds % 3600) // 60

    return {
        'days': days,
        'hours': remaining_hours,
        'minutes': remaining_minutes,
    }
```

This Python function does the following:
1. Converts the `given_date` to a `datetime` object if it's provided as a string.
2. Gets the current date and time using `datetime.now()`.
3. Calculates the difference between the current date and the given date.
4. Extracts the number of days, hours, and minutes from the time difference.
5. Returns these values in a dictionary.
