Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.
 *
 * @param givenDate - The date to compare against the current date.
 * @returns An object containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
 * {
 *     days: days,
 *     hours: remainingHours,
 *     minutes: remainingMinutes,
 * }
 */
struct TimeDifference {
    int days;
    int hours;
    int minutes;
};

TimeDifference calculateTimeDifference(const std::string& givenDate);
```

In this C++ version:
- I've defined a `struct` named `TimeDifference` to hold the result of the time difference calculation.
- The function `calculateTimeDifference` takes a `std::string` representing the date and returns an instance of `TimeDifference`.
