Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments matching the JavaScript version:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the time difference between a given date and the current date.
 *
 * @param givenDate - The date to compare against the current date.
 * @returns - A struct containing days, hours, and minutes elapsed.
 * {
 *         int days;
 *         int hours;
 *         int minutes;
 * }
 */
TimeDifference calculateTimeDifference(const std::string& givenDate);
```

This maintains the same structure and intent as your original JavaScript signature.
