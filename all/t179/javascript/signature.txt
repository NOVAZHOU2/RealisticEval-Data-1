Hereâ€™s the equivalent JavaScript function signature along with the comments rewritten in JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Copies all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the target directory.
 *
 * @param {string} sourceDir - The source directory from which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 * @param {string} targetDir - The target directory to which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function copyDirectory(sourceDir, targetDir) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Name**: Converted from `copy_directory` (Python) to `copyDirectory` (JavaScript) to follow JavaScript naming conventions.
- **Parameter Types**: Retained type annotations but adapted them to JSDoc syntax.
- **Returns**: Included a return type (`void`) to indicate that the function does not return a value.
