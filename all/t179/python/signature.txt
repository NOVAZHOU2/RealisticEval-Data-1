To convert the Java function signature you provided to a Python function signature, we need to make a few adjustments, considering Python's conventions and exception handling.
Here’s how the Java function signature translates into Python:
Java Code:
java
/** 
 * Copies all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the target directory.
 * @param sourceDir The source directory from which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 * @param targetDir The target directory to which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 * @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs while copying files or directories.
 */
public static void copyDirectory(File sourceDir, File targetDir) throws IOException {}
Python Equivalent:
In Python, we typically use Path objects from the pathlib module to handle file system paths, and we can raise exceptions directly without specifying them in the function signature. Here’s the Python version:
python
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

def copy_directory(source_dir: Path, target_dir: Path) -> None:
    """
    Copies all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the target directory.

    :param source_dir: The source directory from which files and subdirectories will be copied.
    :param target_dir: The target directory to which files and subdirectories will be copied.
    :raises IOError: If an I/O error occurs while copying files or directories.
    """
    shutil.copytree(source_dir, target_dir)
Key Changes:
Function Name: The function name in Python uses snake_case (i.e., copy_directory).
Parameters: Parameters are type-annotated using Path from the pathlib module.
Return Type: The function returns None, which is the default for functions that do not return a value.
Docstring: The Java documentation comment has been converted into a Python docstring.
Exception Handling: In Python, exceptions such as IOError can be raised during the execution of shutil.copytree(), and this is documented in the docstring rather than in the function signature.
This code now reflects a similar functionality to the original Java method but conforms to Python's idiomatic practices.
