Hereâ€™s the equivalent TypeScript function signature with documentation comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Copies all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the target directory.
 *
 * @param sourceDir - The source directory from which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 * @param targetDir - The target directory to which files and subdirectories will be copied.
 */
function copyDirectory(sourceDir: string, targetDir: string): void {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This translation preserves the original functionality and structure while adapting the comments and types appropriately. If you need further conversions or have specific aspects to delve into, feel free to ask!
