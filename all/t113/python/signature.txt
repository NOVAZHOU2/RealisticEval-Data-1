To convert the JavaScript code signature provided into a Python code signature, we'll follow Python's conventions for function definitions and type hints. Here's the equivalent Python code signature:
python
def get_css_from_sheet(sheet: 'CSSStyleSheet') -> str:
    """ 
    Extract all the CSS rules from a given CSSStyleSheet and concatenate them into a string.

    Args:
        sheet (CSSStyleSheet): The stylesheet object from which to extract CSS rules.

    Returns:
        str: A single string containing all CSS rules, or an empty string if the sheet is invalid or inaccessible.
    """
    pass
Explanation:
Function Name: The function name get_css_from_sheet uses snake_case, which is the convention in Python.
Parameter Type: The parameter sheet is annotated with its type (CSSStyleSheet). In this case, itâ€™s enclosed in quotes because we assume CSSStyleSheet is a class defined elsewhere (or you can import it).
Return Type: The return type is specified as str, indicating that the function will return a string.
Docstring: The JavaScript JSDoc comments are converted into a Python docstring format, which is enclosed in triple quotes. It describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
You can implement the functionality of the function inside the pass statement when you're ready to write the logic.
