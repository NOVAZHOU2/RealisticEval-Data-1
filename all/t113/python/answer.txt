To convert the provided JavaScript function into Python, we need to consider how to handle CSS stylesheets and rules in Python, as it doesn't have built-in equivalents to the JavaScript DOM manipulation methods.
Hereâ€™s how you can convert the JavaScript function getCSSFromSheet(sheet) into Python. This Python version assumes you have access to a library that can handle CSS stylesheets, like cssutils, which can parse CSS.
JavaScript Code
javascript
function getCSSFromSheet(sheet) {
    // Check if the sheet is a valid CSSStyleSheet and has rules we can access
    if (!(sheet instanceof CSSStyleSheet) || !sheet.cssRules) {
        return '';
    }
    // Use Array.from to convert the CSSRuleList into an array and then map and join to construct the final CSS string
    return Array.from(sheet.cssRules)
        .map(rule => rule.cssText)
        .join('');
}
Converted Python Code
Here's how you might implement the equivalent function in Python:
python
from cssutils import parseString

def get_css_from_sheet(sheet):
    """
    Extracts CSS rules from a given CSS stylesheet.

    Args:
        sheet (str): A string representation of the CSS stylesheet.

    Returns:
        str: A concatenated string of CSS rules.
    """
    # Check if the sheet is a valid CSS string
    if not isinstance(sheet, str):
        return ''
    
    # Parse the CSS string to get the stylesheet object
    stylesheet = parseString(sheet)

    # Extract the CSS rules and concatenate them
    css_rules = []
    for rule in stylesheet.cssRules:
        css_rules.append(rule.cssText)

    return ''.join(css_rules)

# Example usage:
css_string = """
    body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
"""

# Call the function
result = get_css_from_sheet(css_string)
print(result)
Explanation of the Python Code:
Imports:
We import parseString from the cssutils library to parse CSS strings. You'll need to install cssutils if you haven't already. You can do this with:
bash
pip install cssutils
Function Definition:
The function get_css_from_sheet(sheet) takes a string representation of the CSS stylesheet.
Type Checking:
It checks whether the input sheet is a string. If it isn't, it returns an empty string.
Parsing the CSS:
The CSS string is parsed to create a stylesheet object.
Extracting CSS Rules:
We iterate through the cssRules of the parsed stylesheet and append each rule's text to the css_rules list.
Concatenating and Returning:
Finally, we join all the rules together into a single string and return it.
Example Usage:
An example CSS string is provided, and the function is called to extract and print the CSS rules.
This Python function effectively mimics the behavior of the original JavaScript function while adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
