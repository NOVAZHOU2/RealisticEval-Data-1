Here's the Java code signature with comments corresponding to your JavaScript code:

```java
/**
 * Extract all the CSS rules from a given CSSStyleSheet and concatenate them into a string.
 *
 * @param sheet The stylesheet object from which to extract CSS rules.
 * @return A single string containing all CSS rules, or an empty string if the sheet is invalid or inaccessible.
 */
public String getCSSFromSheet(CSSStyleSheet sheet) {
}
```

This maintains the structure and comments from the JavaScript version while using appropriate Java syntax.
