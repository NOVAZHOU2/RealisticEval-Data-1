Certainly! Here's the Java code signature with the comments preserved, matching the JavaScript code signature:

```java
/**
 * Extract all the CSS rules from a given CSSStyleSheet and concatenate them into a string
 *
 * @param sheet The stylesheet object from which to extract CSS rules.
 * @return A single string containing all CSS rules, or an empty string if the sheet is invalid or inaccessible.
 */
public static String getCSSFromSheet(CSSStyleSheet sheet) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comments**: The Java doc comments are preserved to match the JavaScript documentation style.
2. **Method Signature**: The method signature is defined with the appropriate parameter type and return type.

This provides a clear and consistent way to document and define the method in Java. You can add the implementation details inside the method body as needed.
