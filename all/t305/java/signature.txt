Hereâ€™s the Java code signature that mirrors the JavaScript structure while keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Define a class called SeededRandom for generating pseudorandom numbers with a specific seed.
 */
public class SeededRandom {
    /**
     * Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.
     * @param seed The initial seed value for the random number generator.
     */
    public SeededRandom(long seed) {
        // Constructor implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
     * @return A pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
     */
    public double rand() {
        // Method implementation goes here
        return 0; // Placeholder return statement
    }
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The class is declared as `public`.
- The constructor parameter type is changed from `number` (JavaScript) to `long` (Java).
- The return type for the `rand` method is specified as `double`, and a placeholder return statement is added. 

This structure maintains the comments and logic layout from the original JavaScript code.
