Hereâ€™s how you can translate the provided JavaScript code for a SeededRandom class into Python. The Python version uses similar logic and follows the structure of the original code closely.
python
class SeededRandom:
    """
    A class for generating pseudorandom numbers with a specific seed.
    """

    def __init__(self, seed):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.

        :param seed: The initial seed value for the random number generator.
        """
        self.seed = seed

    def rand(self):
        """
        Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.

        :return: A pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        """
        # LCG parameters
        multiplier = 1664525  # Multiplier value for the LCG
        increment = 1013904223  # Increment value for the LCG
        modulus = 2 ** 32  # Modulus value (2^32) for the LCG

        # Update the seed using the LCG formula
        self.seed = (multiplier * self.seed + increment) % modulus

        # Normalize the seed to a value between 0 and 1
        return self.seed / modulus
Explanation
Class Definition: The class is defined using the class keyword in Python, similar to JavaScript.
Constructor: The __init__ method initializes the instance with a seed value.
Method Definition: The rand method generates a pseudorandom number using the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm. The logic for updating the seed and normalizing it to a value between 0 and 1 remains the same as in the JavaScript version.
Usage Example
You can use the class in the following way:
python
# Create an instance of SeededRandom
random_generator = SeededRandom(seed=12345)

# Generate a random number
print(random_generator.rand())  # Example output: 0.3096531987548467
This example creates an instance of the SeededRandom class with a seed of 12345 and generates a random number.
