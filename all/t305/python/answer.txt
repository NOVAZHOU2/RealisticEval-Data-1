Here is how you can convert your JavaScript code into Python:

```python
import time

class SeededRandom:
    def __init__(self, seed=None):
        if seed is None:
            seed = int(time.time())
        self.seed = seed

    def rand(self):
        """Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm."""
        self.seed = (self.seed * 1664525 + 1013904223) % 4294967296
        return self.seed / 4294967296.0
```

In this Python version of your JavaScript code, I used the current system time in seconds since the epoch (`time.time()`) as the default seed when no seed was provided.

The `rand()` method uses a simple Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm to generate the next pseudo-random integer. This integer is then divided by the maximum possible integer value (`4294967296` or `2^32`) to produce a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). 

This implementation assumes that the seed is an integer and that it's being treated as such throughout the computation. If the seed were to be a different type (e.g., a string), additional conversions would need to be added to ensure compatibility.
