To convert the provided JavaScript Jest test cases into Python's unittest framework, we will create a test class that mirrors the structure and assertions of the original tests. Below is the equivalent Python code using unittest for the SeededRandom class.
python
import unittest

class SeededRandom:
    """
    A class for generating pseudorandom numbers with a specific seed.
    """

    def __init__(self, seed):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.
        
        :param seed: The initial seed value for the random number generator.
        """
        self.seed = seed
        self.m = 2**31  # A large prime number
        self.a = 48271  # Multiplier
        self.c = 0  # Increment
        self.last_random = seed % self.m  # Ensure the seed is within range

    def rand(self):
        """

        self.last_random = (self.a * self.last_random + self.c) % self.m
        return self.last_random / self.m  # Scale to [0, 1)

Explanation:
Class Definition:
The SeededRandom class remains the same as defined earlier for generating pseudorandom numbers.
Unit Test Class:
TestSeededRandom inherits from unittest.TestCase, which is required for using the unittest framework.
Each test case method corresponds to a test in the original Jest code, and it uses assertions to check expected behavior:
self.assertAlmostEqual() checks if two numbers are approximately equal.
self.assertNotAlmostEqual() ensures that two values are not approximately equal.
self.assertGreaterEqual() and self.assertLess() validate that values are within the expected range.
self.assertNotEqual() checks that two sequences are different.
self.assertEqual() confirms that two sequences generated from the same seed are identical.
Running the Tests:
The test suite can be run directly from the command line or an IDE that supports Python scripts, allowing you to verify the behavior of the SeededRandom class as specified in the original JavaScript tests.
You can copy this code into a .py file and execute it to run the tests. The output will indicate whether all tests passed successfully.
