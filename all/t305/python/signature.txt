To convert the provided JavaScript class SeededRandom into a Python class, we can follow these steps:
Define the class in Python using the class keyword.
Use the __init__ method for the constructor, which initializes the instance with a seed.
Implement the rand method to generate a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
Here's how the converted code looks in Python:
python
class SeededRandom:
    """
    Define a class called SeededRandom for generating pseudorandom numbers with a specific seed.
    """

    def __init__(self, seed):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.
        
        :param seed: The initial seed value for the random number generator.
        """
        self.seed = seed
        self.m = 2**31  # A large prime number
        self.a = 48271  # Multiplier
        self.c = 0  # Increment
        self.last_random = seed % self.m  # Ensure the seed is within range

    def rand(self):
        """
        Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
        
        :returns: A pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        """
        self.last_random = (self.a * self.last_random + self.c) % self.m
        return self.last_random / self.m  # Scale to [0, 1)
Explanation:
Class Definition: The class SeededRandom is defined using the class keyword.
Constructor (__init__):
Takes a seed parameter to initialize the random number generator.
Uses parameters typical for an LCG: a large modulus (m), a multiplier (a), and an increment (c). Here, c is set to 0, which is common for LCGs.
The last_random variable holds the last generated random number, starting with the seed.
Random Number Generation (rand):
Updates the last_random using the LCG formula: (a * last_random + c) % m.
Returns a number scaled to the range [0, 1).
This Python class can now be used to generate pseudorandom numbers with a specified seed, mirroring the functionality of the original JavaScript class.
