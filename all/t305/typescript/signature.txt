Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code signature converted to TypeScript, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Define a class called SeededRandom for generating pseudorandom numbers with a specific seed
 */
class SeededRandom {
    /**
     * Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.
     * @param seed - The initial seed value for the random number generator.
     */
    constructor(seed: number) {

    }

    /**
     * Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
     * @returns A pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
     */
    rand(): number {

    }
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Type Annotations**: Added `: number` to the `seed` parameter in the constructor and `: number` to the `rand` method's return type. 

This TypeScript signature retains the same functionality while providing type safety.
