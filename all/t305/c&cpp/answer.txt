Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ code for the provided JavaScript `SeededRandom` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

class SeededRandom {
private:
    uint32_t seed;

public:
    /**
     * Initializes a new instance of the SeededRandom class with a given seed.
     * @param seed - The initial seed value for the random number generator.
     */
    SeededRandom(uint32_t seed) : seed(seed) {}

    /**
     * Generates a random number between 0 and 1 using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
     * @return A pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
     */
    double rand() {
        const uint32_t a = 1664525;
        const uint32_t c = 1013904223;
        seed = (a * seed + c) % UINT32_MAX;
        return static_cast<double>(seed) / UINT32_MAX;
    }
};

int main() {
    SeededRandom sr(42);
    std::cout << "Random number: " << sr.rand() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The `SeededRandom` class is defined with a private member variable `seed`.
2. **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `seed` with the provided value.
3. **rand Method**: The `rand` method implements the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm to generate a pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). The constants `a` and `c` are used in the LCG formula.
4. **Main Function**: An example usage of the `SeededRandom` class is shown in the `main` function.

This C++ code should provide similar functionality to the original JavaScript code.
