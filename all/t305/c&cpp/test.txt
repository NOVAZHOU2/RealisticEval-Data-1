Certainly! Below is an equivalent C++ Catch2 test case for the JavaScript Jest test case you provided. Note that I'll assume some basic functionality for the `SeededRandom` class in C++. If you have more specific requirements or additional methods, please provide them.

First, let's define the `SeededRandom` class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <random>

class SeededRandom {
private:
    std::mt19937 generator;
public:
    // Constructor initializes the random number generator with a given seed
    SeededRandom(unsigned int seed) : generator(seed) {}

    // Generates a random number between 0 and 1
    double rand() {
        std::uniform_real_distribution<double> distribution(0.0, 1.0);
        return distribution(generator);
    }
};
```

Now, let's write the Catch2 test cases for the `SeededRandom` class:

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"

TEST_CASE("SeededRandom Class", "[SeededRandom]") {
    SECTION("Constructor initializes with correct seed") {
        SeededRandom sr(42);
        REQUIRE(sr.rand() != SeededRandom(0).rand()); // Different seeds should produce different results
    }

    SECTION("rand method generates numbers between 0 and 1") {
        SeededRandom sr(42);
        double randomValue = sr.rand();
        REQUIRE(randomValue >= 0.0 && randomValue < 1.0); // Ensure the value is within [0, 1)
    }

    SECTION("rand method produces consistent values for the same seed") {
        SeededRandom sr(42);
        double firstRandomValue = sr.rand();
        double secondRandomValue = sr.rand();
        REQUIRE(firstRandomValue == secondRandomValue); // Same seed should produce the same sequence
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `SeededRandom` class uses `std::mt19937` for the random number generation, which is a modern Mersenne Twister engine.
   - The `rand` method uses `std::uniform_real_distribution` to generate a uniform real number between 0 and 1.

2. **Catch2 Test Cases**:
   - **Constructor**: Ensures that the random number generator is initialized correctly with a given seed.
   - **rand Method**: Checks if the generated random numbers are within the range [0, 1).
   - **Consistency Check**: Ensures that the same seed produces the same sequence of random numbers.

Make sure you have Catch2 installed and properly configured in your project to run these tests. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!
