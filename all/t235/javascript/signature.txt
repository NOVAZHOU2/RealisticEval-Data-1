 * This function accepts the latitude and longitude of the two points as parameters and returns the azimuth from the first point to the second point in degrees.
 *
 * @param {number} lat1 - Latitude of the starting point in decimal degrees.
 * @param {number} lon1 - Longitude of the starting point in decimal degrees.
 * @param {number} lat2 - Latitude of the ending point in decimal degrees.
 * @param {number} lon2 - Longitude of the ending point in decimal degrees.
 * @returns {number} - Bearing in degrees from the starting point to the ending point, ranging from 0 to 360.

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc style comments for documenting functions, which is similar to Python's docstrings. The `@param` tag is used to describe each parameter, including its type and a brief description, while the `@returns` tag describes the return value.
