Sure! Below is an example of how you can convert your Python unittest test class to a JavaScript test case using Jest. Note that I'll assume you have a corresponding `calculateBearing` function implemented in JavaScript.

```javascript
// Assuming calculateBearing is implemented somewhere in your project
const { calculateBearing } = require('./path-to-your-calculate-bearing-function');

describe('calculateBearing', () => {
  it('should calculate the correct bearing between two points', () => {
    const lat1 = 48.8566; // Paris, France
    const lon1 = 2.3522;
    const lat2 = 51.5074; // London, UK
    const lon2 = -0.1278;

    const expectedBearing = 90.0; // Approximate bearing from Paris to London

    const calculatedBearing = calculateBearing(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2);

    expect(calculatedBearing).toBeCloseTo(expectedBearing, 1); // Allowing for a small margin of error
  });

  it('should handle edge cases correctly', () => {
    const lat1 = 0; // Equator, Prime Meridian
    const lon1 = 0;
    const lat2 = 90; // North Pole
    const lon2 = 0;

    const expectedBearing = 0.0; // Bearing from equator to north pole should be 0 degrees

    const calculatedBearing = calculateBearing(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2);

    expect(calculatedBearing).toBe(expectedBearing);
  });
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing the Function**: The `calculateBearing` function is imported from the appropriate module or file where it is defined.
  
2. **Describe Block**: The `describe` block groups related tests together. In this case, all tests related to the `calculateBearing` function are grouped under the `calculateBearing` describe block.

3. **It Blocks**: Each `it` block contains a specific test case. The first test checks if the function calculates the correct bearing between two points, and the second test checks how the function handles edge cases.

4. **Expectations**: The `expect` function is used to assert that the output of `calculateBearing` matches the expected result. `toBeCloseTo` allows for a small margin of error, which is useful when dealing with floating-point numbers.

Make sure you have Jest installed in your project and properly configured. If you haven't already, you can install Jest using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
# or
yarn add --dev jest
```

Then, you can run your tests using the following command:

```bash
npx jest
# or
yarn jest
```

This will execute all the tests in your project, including the ones written in Jest.
