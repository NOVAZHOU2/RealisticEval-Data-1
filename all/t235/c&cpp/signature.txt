Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ function signature for the provided Python function, along with the necessary comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Calculates the azimuth between two points on the Earth.
 *
 * @param lat1 The latitude of the starting point in decimal degrees.
 * @param lon1 The longitude of the starting point in decimal degrees.
 * @param lat2 The latitude of the ending point in decimal degrees.
 * @param lon2 The longitude of the ending point in decimal degrees.
 *
 * @return The bearing in degrees from the starting point to the ending point, ranging from 0 to 360.
 */
double calculateBearing(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2);
```

This C++ function signature maintains the same parameters and return type as the original Python function, ensuring that it can be used in a C++ program similarly to how the Python function would be used.
