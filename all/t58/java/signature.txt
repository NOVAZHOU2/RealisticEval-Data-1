Sure, here is the equivalent Java code with the same function signature and comments:

```java
/**
 * Calculate the probability that n red balls will be drawn when 15 balls are randomly returned 
 * from a jar containing x red balls and y blue balls.
 *
 * @param n number of red balls to be drawn
 * @param x number of red balls in the jar
 * @param y number of blue balls in the jar
 * @return the probability of drawing exactly n red balls
 */
public double probabilityOfRedBalls(int n, int x, int y) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that you would need to implement the logic for calculating the probability inside the `probabilityOfRedBalls` method in Java.
