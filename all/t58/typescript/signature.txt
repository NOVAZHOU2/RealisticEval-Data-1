Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the probability that n red balls will be drawn when 15 balls are randomly returned from a jar containing x red balls and y blue balls.
 *
 * @param n - Number of red balls to be drawn.
 * @param x - Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param y - Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @returns The probability of drawing exactly n red balls.
 */
function probabilityOfRedBalls(n: number, x: number, y: number): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This TypeScript function has the same parameters and return type as the original Python function, and it includes JSDoc-style comments for documentation purposes.
