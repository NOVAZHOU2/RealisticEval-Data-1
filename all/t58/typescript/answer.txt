Here is your Python function translated into TypeScript:

```typescript
function probabilityOfRedBalls(n: number, x: number, y: number): number {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

Please note that the implementation of the function is not provided in the original question. You would need to fill in the function body with the logic equivalent to your Python function.
