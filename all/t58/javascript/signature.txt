Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python function with the same comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the probability that n red balls will be drawn when 15 balls are randomly returned from a jar containing x red balls and y blue balls.
 *
 * @param {number} n - Number of red balls to be drawn.
 * @param {number} x - Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param {number} y - Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @returns {number} The probability of drawing exactly n red balls.
 */
function probabilityOfRedBalls(n, x, y) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

In this JavaScript version, I've used JSDoc-style comments to document the function parameters and return value. Note that JavaScript doesn't have type hints like Python, so the types are specified within the comment documentation for clarity.
