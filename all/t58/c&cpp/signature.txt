```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

/**
 * Calculate the probability that n red balls will be drawn when 15 balls are randomly returned from a jar containing x red balls and y blue balls.
 *
 * @param n Number of red balls to be drawn.
 * @param x Number of red balls in the jar.
 * @param y Number of blue balls in the jar.
 * @return The probability of drawing exactly n red balls.
 */
double probability_of_red_balls(int n, int x, int y) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that you would need to implement the actual logic inside the `probability_of_red_balls` function to calculate the probability based on combinatorial mathematics or other appropriate statistical methods.
