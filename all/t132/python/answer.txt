To convert the provided JavaScript code that uses the fs module for file operations into Python, we can use the built-in open function for reading and writing files. Below is the equivalent Python code with comments and error handling similar to the original JavaScript version.
Converted Python Code
python
import os

def read_file(file_path):
    """
    Reads the content of a file synchronously and returns it as a string.

    :param file_path: The path to the file to be read.
    :return: The content of the file as a UTF-8 encoded string.
    :raises IOError: Raises an IOError if the file cannot be read.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return file.read()
    except Exception as error:
        raise IOError(f"Failed to read file at {file_path}: {error}")

def write_file(file_path, data):
    """
    Writes data to a file synchronously.

    :param file_path: The path to the file where data will be written.
    :param data: The data to be written to the file.
    :raises IOError: Raises an IOError if the file cannot be written.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(data)
    except Exception as error:
        raise IOError(f"Failed to write file at {file_path}: {error}")

# Example usage:
# content = read_file('example.txt')
# write_file('output.txt', 'Hello, World!')
Explanation of the Code:
Imports:
In Python, we use import os if we need to handle file path manipulations, but it's not strictly necessary for this example.
read_file Function:
This function takes a file path as a parameter, attempts to read the file's content, and returns it as a UTF-8 encoded string.
It uses a try block to catch exceptions. If reading fails, it raises an IOError with an informative message.
write_file Function:
This function takes a file path and data to write to the file.
Similar to read_file, it uses a try block for error handling and raises an IOError if writing fails.
File Handling:
The with statement is used for file operations, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its block of code is executed, even if an error occurs.
Exception Handling:
Python raises a generic Exception for any errors encountered during file operations, which is caught and re-raised as an IOError to maintain consistency with the original JavaScript code.
This Python implementation closely mirrors the functionality of the original JavaScript code, providing similar error handling and file operations.
