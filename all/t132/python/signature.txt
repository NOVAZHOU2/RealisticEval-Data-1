To convert the JavaScript function signatures you provided into Python function signatures, we can use Python's docstring conventions and appropriate file handling methods. Below is the Python equivalent of the JavaScript code, which uses os and io libraries to read from and write to files.
Python Code
python
import os

def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Reads the content of a file synchronously and returns it as a string.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file to be read.

    Returns:
        str: The content of the file as a UTF-8 encoded string.

    Raises:
        OSError: Throws an error if the file cannot be read.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return file.read()
    except OSError as e:
        raise OSError(f"Unable to read file at {file_path}: {str(e)}")


def write_file(file_path: str, data: str) -> None:
    """Writes question to a file synchronously.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file where the question will be written.
        data (str): The question to be written to the file.

    Raises:
        OSError: Throws an error if the file cannot be written.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(data)
    except OSError as e:
        raise OSError(f"Unable to write file at {file_path}: {str(e)}")
Key Changes Explained:
Function Names: In Python, it's common to use snake_case for function names instead of camelCase, so readFile becomes read_file, and writeFile becomes write_file.
Type Annotations: Python allows you to specify the type of arguments and return values using annotations (e.g., file_path: str).
Docstrings: The docstring format is slightly different in Python. You typically use triple quotes and include Args, Returns, and Raises sections.
Error Handling: In Python, you use exceptions (like OSError) to handle errors related to file operations.
File Handling: The with statement is used to open files, ensuring that they are properly closed after their block is executed.
This Python code will behave similarly to the JavaScript version, allowing synchronous reading from and writing to files while handling potential errors.
