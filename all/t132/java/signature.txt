Sure! Here’s the Java code signature with comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Use Java syntax to define the file read and write operation methods.
 */

/**
 * Reads the content of a file synchronously and returns it as a string.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the file to be read.
 * @return - The content of the file as a UTF-8 encoded string.
 * @throws IOException - Throws an IOException if the file cannot be read.
 */
public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {

}

/**
 * Writes data to a file synchronously.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the file where data will be written.
 * @param data - The data to be written to the file.
 * @throws IOException - Throws an IOException if the file cannot be written.
 */
public static void writeFile(String filePath, String data) throws IOException {

}
```

Is there anything else you’d like to explore about this conversion?
