Sure! Here's the equivalent Java code for your JavaScript functions:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FileOperations {

    /**
     * Reads the content of a file synchronously and returns it as a string.
     *
     * @param filePath - The path to the file to be read.
     * @return - The content of the file as a UTF-8 encoded string.
     * @throws IOException - Throws an IOException if the file cannot be read.
     */
    public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
        try {
            return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath)), "UTF-8");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to read file at " + filePath + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    /**
     * Writes data to a file synchronously.
     *
     * @param filePath - The path to the file where data will be written.
     * @param data - The data to be written to the file.
     * @throws IOException - Throws an IOException if the file cannot be written.
     */
    public static void writeFile(String filePath, String data) throws IOException {
        try {
            Files.write(Paths.get(filePath), data.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to write file at " + filePath + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
