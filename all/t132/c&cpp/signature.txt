Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments preserved from the original JavaScript code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

/**
 * Use C++ syntax to define the file read and write operation functions
 */

/**
 * Reads the content of a file synchronously and returns it as a string.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the file to be read.
 * @returns The content of the file as a UTF-8 encoded string.
 * @throws std::runtime_error - Throws an error if the file cannot be read.
 */
std::string readFile(const std::string& filePath);

/**
 * Writes data to a file synchronously.
 *
 * @param filePath - The path to the file where data will be written.
 * @param data - The data to be written to the file.
 * @throws std::runtime_error - Throws an error if the file cannot be written.
 */
void writeFile(const std::string& filePath, const std::string& data);
```

This keeps the structure and comments consistent with the JavaScript version while adhering to C++ syntax. If you need the implementations or further adjustments, let me know!
