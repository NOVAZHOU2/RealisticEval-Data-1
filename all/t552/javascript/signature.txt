Here is the JavaScript version of your Python function:

```javascript
/**
 * Compares two sets of floats for equality within a relative and absolute tolerance.
 *
 * @param {Array} set1 - The first set of floats.
 * @param {Array} set2 - The second set of floats.
 * @param {number} [rtol=1e-5] - The relative tolerance (default: 1e-5).
 * @param {number} [atol=1e-6] - The absolute tolerance (default: 1e-6).
 * @returns {boolean} True if the sets are equal within the specified tolerances, False otherwise.
 */
function areSetsEqual(set1, set2, rtol = 1e-5, atol = 1e-6) {
```

Note that in JavaScript, we use `===` operator instead of `==` for comparison, and there's no need to explicitly define types for parameters because JavaScript is loosely typed. Also, the comment syntax is slightly different in JavaScript.
