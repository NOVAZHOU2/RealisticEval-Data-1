Here is how you could write the equivalent TypeScript function:

```typescript
function areSetsEqual(set1: number[], set2: number[], rtol: number = 1e-5, atol: number = 1e-6): boolean {
    if (set1.length !== set2.length) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < set1.length; i++) {
        const diff = Math.abs(set1[i] - set2[i]);
        if (diff > rtol * Math.max(Math.abs(set1[i]), Math.abs(set2[i])) + atol) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

In TypeScript, we don't have native support for `numpy` or its functions, so I replaced them with JavaScript's native `Math.abs`, which calculates the absolute value of a number. Also, since TypeScript doesn't support tuples as in Python, I used arrays instead.
