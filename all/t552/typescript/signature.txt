Here is how you can convert the Python function signature into TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Compares two sets of floats for equality within a relative and absolute tolerance.
 *
 * @param set1 - The first set of floats.
 * @param set2 - The second set of floats.
 * @param rtol - The relative tolerance (default: 1e-5).
 * @param atol - The absolute tolerance (default: 1e-6).
 * @returns True if the sets are equal within the specified tolerances, False otherwise.
 */
function areSetsEqual(set1: number[], set2: number[], rtol: number = 1e-5, atol: number = 1e-6): boolean {
```

Please note that in TypeScript, we use `number[]` instead of `set`, and we don't have a built-in way to handle floating-point comparisons with tolerance like Python's `numpy.allclose`. If you need to perform such comparison in TypeScript, you might need to write your own function or use an external library.
