Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function for the given Python code:

```javascript
function getLineSegmentIntersection(seg1, seg2) {
    /**
     * Calculate the intersection point of two line segments, if it exists.
     *
     * @param {Array} seg1 - Coordinates of the first line segment, defined as [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]].
     * @param {Array} seg2 - Coordinates of the second line segment, defined as [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]].
     * @returns {Array|null} - The [x, y] coordinates of the intersection point if the line segments intersect,
     *                        otherwise null.
     */

    // Extract points
    const [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]] = seg1;
    const [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = seg2;

    // Calculate denominators
    const denominator = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4);

    // Check if lines are parallel or coincident
    if (denominator === 0) return null;

    // Calculate intersection point
    const t = ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denominator;
    const u = -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denominator;

    // Check if intersection point lies on both segments
    if (t >= 0 && t <= 1 && u >= 0 && u <= 1) {
        return [(x1 + t * (x2 - x1)), (y1 + t * (y2 - y1))];
    }

    return null;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Extract Points**: The points of the line segments are extracted into variables.
- **Denominator Calculation**: The determinant (denominator) is calculated to check if the lines are parallel or coincident.
- **Check Parallelism**: If the denominator is zero, the lines are parallel or coincident, and there is no unique intersection point.
- **Calculate Intersection Point**: Using the formula derived from solving the system of linear equations representing the line segments, the intersection point is calculated.
- **Check Segment Bounds**: Ensure that the intersection point lies within both line segments. If it does, return the intersection point; otherwise, return `null`.

This JavaScript function should work similarly to the provided Python function.
