Sure! Here is the JavaScript version of your Python code with the same function signature and comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the intersection point of two line segments, if it exists.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} seg1 - Coordinates of the first line segment, defined as [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]].
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} seg2 - Coordinates of the second line segment, defined as [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]].
 * @returns {Array<number>|null} - The [x, y] coordinates of the intersection point if the line segments intersect,
 *                                otherwise null.
 */
function getLineSegmentIntersection(seg1, seg2) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

This JavaScript function `getLineSegmentIntersection` has the same parameters and return type as your original Python function, along with the JSDoc comment that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value.
