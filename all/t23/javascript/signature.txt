Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JSDoc standards:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the intersection point of two line segments, if it exists.
 *
 * @param {Array} seg1 - Coordinates of the first line segment, defined as [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]].
 * @param {Array} seg2 - Coordinates of the second line segment, defined as [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]].
 * @returns {Array|null} - The [x, y] coordinates of the intersection point if the line segments intersect,
 *                         otherwise null.
 */
function getLineSegmentIntersection(seg1, seg2) {
    // Unpack segment points
    const [x1, y1] = seg1[0];
    const [x2, y2] = seg1[1];
    const [x3, y3] = seg2[0];
    const [x4, y4] = seg2[1];

    // Compute direction vectors and determinant
    const dx1 = x2 - x1;
    const dy1 = y2 - y1;
    const dx2 = x4 - x3;
    const dy2 = y4 - y3;
    const determinant = dx1 * dy2 - dx2 * dy1;

    // Check for parallel lines or identical segments
    if (Math.abs(determinant) < 1e-10) {
        return null;
    }

    // Calculate intersection parameters
    const t1 = ((x3 - x1) * dy2 - (y3 - y1) * dx2) / determinant;
    const t2 = ((x3 - x1) * dy1 - (y3 - y1) * dx1) / determinant;

    // Allow for a small tolerance in the intersection check
    const tolerance = 1e-10;

    // Check if intersection is within the bounds of the line segments
    if (0 - tolerance <= t1 && t1 <= 1 + tolerance && 0 - tolerance <= t2 && t2 <= 1 + tolerance) {
        const x = x1 + t1 * dx1;
        const y = y1 + t1 * dy1;
        return [parseFloat(x.toFixed(7)), parseFloat(y.toFixed(7))];
    }

    return null;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**: The function is documented using JSDoc comments, which provide clear descriptions of the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
2. **Function Signature**: The function `getLineSegmentIntersection` is defined with the same arguments.
3. **Unpacking Points**: The points are unpacked from the input arrays.
4. **Direction Vectors and Determinant**: The direction vectors and determinant are calculated similarly.
5. **Parallel Lines Check**: The check for parallel lines or identical segments is performed using `Math.abs`.
6. **Intersection Parameters**: The intersection parameters `t1` and `t2` are calculated.
7. **Tolerance Check**: A small tolerance is allowed for checking if the intersection is within the bounds of the line segments.
8. **Return Values**: If the intersection is valid, the coordinates are rounded to 7 decimal places and returned as an array; otherwise, `null` is returned.

This JavaScript code preserves the functionality, logic, and structure of the original Python code while adhering to JSDoc standards for documentation.
