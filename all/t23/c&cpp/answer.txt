Here is the equivalent C++ code for your Python function:

```c++
#include <utility>
#include <optional>

std::optional<std::pair<double, double>> getLineSegmentIntersection(std::pair<double, double> seg1_start, std::pair<double, double> seg1_end, std::pair<double, double> seg2_start, std::pair<double, double> seg2_end)
{
    // Implement the algorithm here
    return {};
}
```

Please note that in C++, you don't have built-in support for optional types like Python does. Therefore, we use `std::optional` which can be empty or contain a value.

The actual algorithm for finding the intersection of two line segments would need to be implemented inside the function body. This could involve calculating the equations of the lines and then solving them simultaneously to find the intersection point.
