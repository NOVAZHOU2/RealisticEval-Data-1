Here is your Python code converted into TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function getLineSegmentIntersection(seg1: [Point, Point], seg2: [Point, Point]): Point | null {
  // Your logic here...
}
```

This function takes in two tuples of points that define each line segment and returns either a point object representing the intersection or `null` if they don't intersect. 

Please note that the actual logic for calculating the intersection has not been implemented in the above code. It would be more complex and beyond the scope of this question.
