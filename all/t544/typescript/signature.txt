Here’s the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Filters out all even numbers from an array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} array - The array of numbers to filter.
 * @returns {number[]} - A new array containing only the odd numbers.
 */
function filterOutEvenNumbers(array: number[]): number[] {
}
```
