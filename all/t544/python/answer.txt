Here is the equivalent Python code for your JavaScript function:

```python
def filter_out_even_numbers(array):
    return [num for num in array if num % 2 != 0]
```

This Python function does exactly the same thing as your JavaScript function: it filters out all even numbers from an array and returns a new list with only the odd numbers. It uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python based on existing lists or other iterable objects.
