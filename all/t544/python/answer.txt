Hereâ€™s how you can convert the provided JavaScript function filterOutEvenNumbers into Python:
Python Code
python
from typing import List

def filter_out_even_numbers(array: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filters out all even numbers from an array.

    Args:
        array (List[int]): The array of numbers to filter.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A new array containing only the odd numbers.
    """
    # Use list comprehension to return a new list with only odd numbers
    return [num for num in array if num % 2 != 0]
Explanation:
Function Definition: The function is defined using def, which is standard in Python.
Type Hinting: The function uses type hinting:
array: List[int] indicates that the input parameter is expected to be a list of integers.
-> List[int] specifies that the function will return a list of integers.
Docstring: A docstring is included to describe the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
Logic: The logic is implemented using a list comprehension:
The expression [num for num in array if num % 2 != 0] creates a new list that includes only the numbers from array that are odd (i.e., num % 2 != 0).
Example Usage
You can use the function like this:
python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
odd_numbers = filter_out_even_numbers(numbers)
print(odd_numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
This Python code accurately reflects the functionality of the original JavaScript function while adhering to Python conventions.
