Here is your JavaScript code translated into Python:

```python
def filter_out_even_numbers(array):
    return [i for i in array if i % 2 != 0]
```

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the odd numbers from the input array. It does this by checking each number (i) in the array to see if it's not divisible by 2 (i.e., it's odd). If the condition is true, the number is included in the new list.
