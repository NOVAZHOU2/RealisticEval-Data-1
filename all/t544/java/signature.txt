Hereâ€™s the Java code signature that mirrors the provided JavaScript signature, including the comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Filters out all even numbers from an array.
 *
 * @param array - The array of numbers to filter.
 * @return - A new list containing only the odd numbers.
 */
public static List<Integer> filterOutEvenNumbers(int[] array) {
}
```

This retains the structure and comments while adjusting for Java syntax and types.
