Here is how you can convert your JavaScript function signature to Java:

```java
/**
 * Filters out all even numbers from an array.
 *
 * @param array The array of numbers to filter.
 * @return A new array containing only the odd numbers.
 */
public static int[] filterOutEvenNumbers(int[] array) {
}
```

In Java, we use `int[]` instead of `{number[]}` for arrays. Also, in Java, there's no built-in way to return multiple values like in JavaScript. Instead, we usually create and return a new array with the filtered results.

If you want to modify the original array instead of creating a new one, you would need to pass it as a parameter and modify it directly inside the method:

```java
/**
 * Modifies the given array to contain only odd numbers.
 *
 * @param array The array of numbers to be modified.
 */
public static void filterOutEvenNumbers(int[] array) {
    // Your code here...
}
```
