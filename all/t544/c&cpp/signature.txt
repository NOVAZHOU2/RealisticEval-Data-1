Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code signature with comments:

```cpp
/**
 * Filters out all even numbers from an array.
 *
 * @param const std::vector<int>& array - The vector of integers to filter.
 * @return std::vector<int> - A new vector containing only the odd numbers.
 */
std::vector<int> filterOutEvenNumbers(const std::vector<int>& array);
```

This function takes a constant reference to a `std::vector<int>` and returns a `std::vector<int>` containing only the odd numbers from the input vector.
