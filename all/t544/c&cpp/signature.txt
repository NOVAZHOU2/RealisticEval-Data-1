Sure! Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Filters out all even numbers from an array.
 *
 * @param array - The vector of numbers to filter.
 * @returns A new vector containing only the odd numbers.
 */
std::vector<int> filterOutEvenNumbers(const std::vector<int>& array) {
}
```
