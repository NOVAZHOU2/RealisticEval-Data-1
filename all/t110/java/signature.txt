Here's the Java code signature with comments preserved:

```java
/**
 * Generate a random UUID of length 36
 * The UUID includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
 *
 * @return A 36-character UUID string.
 */
public static String generateUUID() {
    // Method implementation will go here
}
```
