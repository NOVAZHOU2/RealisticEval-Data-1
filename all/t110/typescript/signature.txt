Sure! Here is the TypeScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Generate a random UUID of length 36
 * The UUID must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
 *
 * @returns {string} A 36-character UUID string.
 */
function generateUUID(): string {
    // Function body goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Type Annotations**: The function `generateUUID` now has a return type annotation `: string`.
2. **Comments**: The comments have been preserved exactly as they were in the original JavaScript code.

This ensures that the TypeScript function signature is properly defined while keeping the original comments intact.
