To convert the JavaScript function signature and its documentation comment to Python code signature and docstring, you can follow this structure. Hereâ€™s how you can represent the function in Python:
JavaScript Signature
javascript
/**
 * Generate a random UUID of length 36
 * The UUID contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit
 *
 * @returns {string} A 36-character UUID string.
 */
function generateUUID() {}
Python Equivalent
python
def generate_uuid() -> str:
    """
    Generate a random UUID of length 36.

    The UUID contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit.

    Returns:
        str: A 36-character UUID string.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation will go here
Explanation:
Function Name:
Changed generateUUID to generate_uuid to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case).
Return Type:
Used -> str to indicate that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
Converted the JavaScript documentation comment to a Python docstring using triple quotes (""").
The description is reformulated to match Python conventions while retaining the original meaning.
Function Implementation:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder, indicating that the function is not yet implemented.
This Python signature effectively communicates the same information as the original JavaScript function signature, adhering to Python's syntax and style conventions.
