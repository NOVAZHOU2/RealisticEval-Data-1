Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments that match your JavaScript code:

```cpp
/**
 * Generate a random UUID of length 36
 * The UUID contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit
 *
 * @returns A 36-character UUID string.
 */
std::string generateUUID() {

}
```

This signature maintains the same structure and comments as your JavaScript function while adapting it to C++ syntax.
