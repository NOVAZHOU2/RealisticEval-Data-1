Hereâ€™s the conversion of the TypeScript function signature to a Python function signature, while retaining the comments. The TypeScript-style comments will be formatted as a Python docstring.
Converted Python Code Signature
python
def compress_string(input: str, max_length: int = 18) -> str:
    """
    Compresses a string to ensure its length does not exceed the specified maximum length.
    If the string exceeds the maximum length, it truncates the string and appends an ellipsis ("...").

    :param input: The string to be compressed.
    :param max_length: The maximum allowed length of the string (default is 18).
    :returns: A compressed string that does not exceed the specified length.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Key Changes Explained:
Function Name:
Changed from compressString to compress_string to follow Python's naming conventions.
Parameter Types:
input: str specifies that the input parameter is a string.
max_length: int = 18 specifies the maximum allowed length with a default value of 18.
Return Type:
The return type is indicated with -> str, signifying that the function returns a string.
Docstring:
The comments from the TypeScript code are converted into a Python docstring format using triple quotes """.
Function Body:
The implementation of the function is represented by pass, indicating that the function is currently not implemented.
This signature is now valid Python code, adhering to Python conventions. Let me know if you need further modifications or explanations!
