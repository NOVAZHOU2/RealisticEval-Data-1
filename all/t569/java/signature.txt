Here's the Java code signature that mirrors the TypeScript signature while keeping the comments intact:

```java
/**
 * Compresses a string to ensure its length does not exceed the specified maximum length.
 * If the string exceeds the maximum length, it truncates the string and appends an ellipsis ("...").
 *
 * @param input - The string to be compressed.
 * @param maxLength - The maximum allowed length of the string (default is 18).
 * @returns A compressed string that does not exceed the specified length.
 */
public static String compressString(String input, int maxLength) {
    // Default maximum length
    if (maxLength <= 0) {
        maxLength = 18;
    }
    // Method implementation goes here...
}
```

### Key Points:
- The method is marked as `public static` to match typical usage in Java.
- The comments are preserved to provide context and documentation for the method.
- The default value handling is mentioned in the implementation note but is not included in the method signature itself, as Java does not support default parameter values directly.
