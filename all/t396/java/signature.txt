Sure, here is the Java version of your Python code with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 *
 * @param nums the input integer list
 * @return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
 */
public int lengthOfLIS(List<Integer> nums) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In Java, you don't need to specify the type for function arguments or return types like in Python's `typing`. Instead, you use Java's built-in classes and methods. The above code defines a method named `lengthOfLIS` that takes a `List<Integer>` as its parameter and returns an `int`.
