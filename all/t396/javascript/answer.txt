Here is your Python code translated into JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLIS = function(nums) {
    /**
     * Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the given array.
     *
     * @param {Array<number>} nums - An array of integers.
     * @returns {number} The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
     */
};
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function `lengthOfLIS` is not provided here because it would depend on how you want to solve the problem, and there are multiple ways to do so. The above code only provides the function signature in JavaScript.
