Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Given an array of integers `nums`, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - Array of integers
 * @return {number} The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this JavaScript version, the function `length_of_LIS` has been renamed to `lengthOfLIS` to follow camelCase naming convention which is common in JavaScript.

The JSDoc comments provide clear documentation for the function, including the parameters and return value.
