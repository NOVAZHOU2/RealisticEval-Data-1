Sure! Here is the JavaScript equivalent with similar comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in a given array of integers.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of integers.
 * @returns {number} - The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

This JavaScript function `lengthOfLIS` takes an array of integers `nums` as an argument and returns the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence. The docstring comments are preserved to explain the purpose and parameters of the function.
