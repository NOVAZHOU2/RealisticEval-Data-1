Sure, here is the equivalent C++ function signature with the same comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>

/**
 * Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in a given array of integers.
 *
 * @param nums The input array of integers.
 * @return The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
int lengthOfLIS(const std::vector<int>& nums);
```

This function takes a constant reference to a vector of integers and returns an integer representing the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
