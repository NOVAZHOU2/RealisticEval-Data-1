Sure, here is the TypeScript code signature with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in it.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input integer array.
 * @returns {number} The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 */
function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
```

This function signature maintains the type information and docstring from the original Python code.
