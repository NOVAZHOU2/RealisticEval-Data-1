Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python code:

```javascript
// Define a class for TreeNode
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root - The root of the binary tree.
 * @returns {Array<number>} A list containing the average values of each level.
 */
function averageOfLevels(root) {
  // Your implementation goes here
}
```

Please note that the function `averageOfLevels` does not have any implementation in the JavaScript version because it's up to you to fill it according to your needs.
