To convert your Python `unittest` test class to a C++ test case using Catch2, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Catch2 if you haven't already. You can download it from [Catch2's GitHub repository](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
2. Write the equivalent C++ test case using Catch2 syntax.

Here is an example of how you might write the C++ test case for the given Python function:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Assuming the function is defined in a file named 'split.cpp'
std::vector<std::string> split_into_sentences(const std::string& text);

TEST_CASE("SplitIntoSentences", "[split]") {
    SECTION("Empty String") {
        std::vector<std::string> result = split_into_sentences("");
        REQUIRE(result.empty());
    }

    SECTION("Single Sentence") {
        std::vector<std::string> result = split_into_sentences("Hello world");
        REQUIRE(result.size() == 1);
        REQUIRE(result[0] == "Hello world");
    }

    SECTION("Multiple Sentences with Different Delimiters") {
        std::vector<std::string> result = split_into_sentences("This is the first sentence. This is the second one! And this is the third.");
        REQUIRE(result.size() == 3);
        REQUIRE(result[0] == "This is the first sentence");
        REQUIRE(result[1] == "This is the second one");
        REQUIRE(result[2] == "And this is the third");
    }

    SECTION("Sentence with Leading/Trailing Whitespace") {
        std::vector<std::string> result = split_into_sentences("   This is a sentence with leading and trailing spaces   ");
        REQUIRE(result.size() == 1);
        REQUIRE(result[0] == "This is a sentence with leading and trailing spaces");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Include Catch2 Header**: The `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>` line includes the Catch2 header file which provides the testing framework.
  
- **Function Definition**: The function `split_into_sentences` is assumed to be defined elsewhere, e.g., in a file named `split.cpp`.

- **Test Case**: The `TEST_CASE` macro defines a new test case named "SplitIntoSentences" with a tag `[split]`.
  
- **Sections**: Each `SECTION` within a `TEST_CASE` represents a different scenario or test case for the main function.
  
- **Assertions**: The `REQUIRE` macro is used to make assertions. If any assertion fails, the test will fail.

### Note:
- Ensure that the `split_into_sentences` function is correctly implemented and available in the same project or linked library.
- Make sure to compile your C++ code with Catch2 included, typically using a command like:
  ```sh
  g++ -std=c++14 -o test_split test_split.cpp split.cpp -lc++abi
  ```
  Adjust the compiler flags according to your environment and setup.
