Here is your Python code signature converted to C++ code signature:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param text The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @return A vector containing sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
std::vector<std::string> splitIntoSentences(const std::string& text);
```

Please note that in C++, you don't have built-in support for type hints like in Python. Therefore, we use `const std::string&` to represent an immutable reference to a string, and `std::vector<std::string>` to represent a list of strings.
