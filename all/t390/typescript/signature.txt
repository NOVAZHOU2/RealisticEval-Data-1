Sure, here is the TypeScript version of your Python function with the same comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param text - The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @returns An array of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text: string): string[] {
    // Your implementation goes here
}
```

In TypeScript, you don't need to explicitly return a type for an array if it's inferred correctly, but I've kept the return type `string[]` to match the Python version.
