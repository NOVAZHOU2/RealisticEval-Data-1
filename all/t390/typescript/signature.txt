Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the given Python function:

```typescript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 * 
 * @param text The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @returns An array of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text: string): string[] {
    // Assuming there's implementation here to split the text into sentences
    // For example, using a simple period as a delimiter
    // Note: This is a simplistic approach and might need a more sophisticated implementation
    const sentences = text.split('.').map(sentence => sentence.trim());
    return sentences;
}
```

This TypeScript function preserves the original functionality and structure of the Python function, including the type annotations and documentation comments converted to JSDoc style.
