Sure, here is the equivalent Java method signature with the same comments:

```java
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Splits the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param text The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @return A list of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
public static List<String> splitIntoSentences(String text) {
```

This Java method signature corresponds to your Python function `split_into_sentences`. It includes the necessary import statement for the `List` type, the method's docstring, and the method declaration itself.
