Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java test class using JUnit for the provided Python unittest class. The Java test class will be placed in the package `org.real.temp` and named `Tester`. It will use appropriate JUnit annotations and assertion methods to preserve the functionality and logic of the tests.

### Java Test Class Using JUnit

```java
package org.real.temp;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Test class for the splitIntoSentences method.
 */
public class Tester {

    /**
     * Tests splitting a basic text with clear punctuation.
     */
    @Test
    public void testBasicSplitting() {
        String text = "Hello world! How are you? I am fine.";
        List<String> expected = Arrays.asList("Hello world!", "How are you?", "I am fine.");
        List<String> result = splitIntoSentences(text);
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }

    /**
     * Tests splitting text that includes quotes and commas.
     */
    @Test
    public void testComplexPunctuation() {
        String text = "He said, This is amazing! Then he left.";
        List<String> expected = Arrays.asList("He said, This is amazing!", "Then he left.");
        List<String> result = splitIntoSentences(text);
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }

    /**
     * Tests text that has no punctuation marks.
     */
    @Test
    public void testWithNoPunctuation() {
        String text = "Hello world how are you";
        List<String> expected = Arrays.asList("Hello world how are you");
        List<String> result = splitIntoSentences(text);
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }

    /**
     * Tests empty string input.
     */
    @Test
    public void testEmptyString() {
        String text = "";
        List<String> expected = Arrays.asList();
        List<String> result = splitIntoSentences(text);
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }

    // Method to be tested
    private List<String> splitIntoSentences(String text) {
        // Check if the input is a string
        if (text == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input must be a string.");
        }

        // Regular expression to split the text where there is a punctuation followed by space or end of string
        // This handles situations where punctuation might be followed by a quotation mark or other punctuation
        Pattern sentenceDelimiters = Pattern.compile("(?<=[.!?])\\s+(?=[A-Z])|(?<=[.!?][\"”’])\\s+(?=[A-Z])");

        // Split the text using the defined regular expression
        String[] sentencesArray = sentenceDelimiters.split(text);

        // Create a list to store the cleaned sentences
        List<String> sentences = new ArrayList<>();

        // Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence and add it to the list
        for (String sentence : sentencesArray) {
            String trimmedSentence = sentence.trim();
            if (!trimmedSentence.isEmpty()) {
                sentences.add(trimmedSentence);
            }
        }

        // Return the cleaned list of sentences
        return sentences;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Package and Class Declaration**:
   - The Java code starts with the package declaration `package org.real.temp;`.
   - The class declaration is `public class Tester {`.

2. **JUnit Annotations**:
   - Each test method is annotated with `@Test` to indicate that it is a test case.

3. **Assertion Methods**:
   - The `assertEquals` method from JUnit is used to assert the equality of the expected and actual results.

4. **Test Methods**:
   - Each test method is named and documented to reflect the purpose of the test.
   - The test data and expected results are set up and compared using assertions.

5. **Helper Method**:
   - The `splitIntoSentences` method is included within the test class for convenience. In a real-world scenario, this method would typically be part of another class and imported here.

### Running the Tests
To run these tests, you can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle, or an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Here’s an example of how you might configure a Maven project to run these tests:

#### POM.xml (Maven Configuration)
```xml
<project>
    ...
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.13.2</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...
</project>
```

#### Running Tests
You can run the tests using the following command:
```sh
mvn test
```

This setup ensures that the tests are executed and the results are displayed in the console.
