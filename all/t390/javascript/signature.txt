Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript function with JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 * 
 * @param {string} text - The input text to be split into sentences.
 * 
 * @returns {Array<string>} - An array of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text) {
    // Function body would go here
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the function's logic isn't included above, as the task was focused on translating the signature and comments. If you need help with the implementation part too, feel free to ask!
