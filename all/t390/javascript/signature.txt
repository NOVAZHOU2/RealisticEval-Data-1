Here is how you can change the Python function signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @returns {Array<string>} - A list of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text) {
```

In JavaScript, there's no need for explicit type declarations like in TypeScript or Python. However, JSDoc (JavaDoc-style documentation comments) can be used to describe types and parameters.
