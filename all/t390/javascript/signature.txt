Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code with the function signature and comments rewritten to conform to JavaScript documentation standards using JSDoc format:

```javascript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @returns {Array<string>} - A list of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text) {
    // Check if the input is a string
    if (typeof text !== 'string') {
        throw new Error('Input must be a string.');
    }

    // Regular expression to split the text where there is a punctuation followed by space or end of string
    // This handles situations where punctuation might be followed by a quotation mark or other punctuation
    const sentenceDelimiters = /(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z])|(?<=[.!?]["”’])\s+(?=[A-Z])/g;

    // Split the text using the defined regular expression
    const sentences = text.split(sentenceDelimiters);

    // Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence
    const cleanedSentences = sentences.filter(sentence => sentence.trim().length > 0).map(sentence => sentence.trim());

    // Return the cleaned list of sentences
    return cleanedSentences;
}

// Example usage
const text = "Hello world! This is an example. Isn't it great? Yes, it is.";
console.log(splitIntoSentences(text));
```

### Explanation:
1. **JSDoc Comments**: The function is documented using JSDoc format, which includes parameter and return type descriptions.
2. **Function Signature**: The function `splitIntoSentences` is defined with a clear parameter and return type description.
3. **Type Check**: The input `text` is checked to ensure it is a string. If not, an error is thrown.
4. **Regular Expression**: The regular expression `sentenceDelimiters` is defined to match sentence delimiters, similar to the Python version.
5. **Splitting Text**: The `text` is split using the regular expression.
6. **Cleaning Sentences**: The resulting array is filtered to remove empty strings and then mapped to trim leading and trailing whitespace.
7. **Return Value**: The cleaned list of sentences is returned.

This JavaScript code preserves the purpose and structure of the original Python code while adhering to JavaScript documentation standards.
