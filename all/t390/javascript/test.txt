Certainly! Below is the equivalent Jest test class for the given Python unittest class. The functionality and logic of the tests are preserved, and all assertions are mapped to appropriate Jest equivalents.

### Python Code:
```python
import unittest

class TestSplitIntoSentences(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_basic_splitting(self):
        # Test splitting a basic text with clear punctuation
        text = "Hello world! How are you? I am fine."
        expected = ["Hello world!", "How are you?", "I am fine."]
        result = split_into_sentences(text)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_complex_punctuation(self):
        # Test splitting text that includes quotes and commas
        text = 'He said, This is amazing! Then he left.'
        expected = ['He said, This is amazing!', "Then he left."]
        result = split_into_sentences(text)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_with_no_punctuation(self):
        # Test text that has no punctuation marks
        text = "Hello world how are you"
        expected = ["Hello world how are you"]
        result = split_into_sentences(text)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_empty_string(self):
        # Test empty string input
        text = ""
        expected = []
        result = split_into_sentences(text)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

### Equivalent Jest Test Class:
```javascript
const splitIntoSentences = require('./splitIntoSentences'); // Import the function to be tested

describe('TestSplitIntoSentences', () => {
    describe('test_basic_splitting', () => {
        it('should correctly split a basic text with clear punctuation', () => {
            const text = "Hello world! How are you? I am fine.";
            const expected = ["Hello world!", "How are you?", "I am fine."];
            const result = splitIntoSentences(text);
            expect(result).toEqual(expected);
        });
    });

    describe('test_complex_punctuation', () => {
        it('should correctly split text that includes quotes and commas', () => {
            const text = 'He said, This is amazing! Then he left.';
            const expected = ['He said, This is amazing!', "Then he left."];
            const result = splitIntoSentences(text);
            expect(result).toEqual(expected);
        });
    });

    describe('test_with_no_punctuation', () => {
        it('should correctly handle text with no punctuation marks', () => {
            const text = "Hello world how are you";
            const expected = ["Hello world how are you"];
            const result = splitIntoSentences(text);
            expect(result).toEqual(expected);
        });
    });

    describe('test_empty_string', () => {
        it('should correctly handle an empty string input', () => {
            const text = "";
            const expected = [];
            const result = splitIntoSentences(text);
            expect(result).toEqual(expected);
        });
    });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing the Function**: The `splitIntoSentences` function is imported at the beginning of the test file.
2. **Describe Blocks**: Each test case is wrapped in a `describe` block to group related tests.
3. **It Blocks**: Each test case is defined using an `it` block, which provides a clear description of what the test does.
4. **Assertions**: The `expect` function is used with `toEqual` to assert that the results match the expected values.

### Structure and Assertions:
- **`describe` Blocks**: These blocks help organize the tests logically.
- **`it` Blocks**: Each `it` block contains a single test case with a descriptive message.
- **`expect` Assertions**: The `expect` function is used to make assertions about the results.

This conversion ensures that the functionality and logic of the tests are preserved while adhering to Jest's testing conventions.
