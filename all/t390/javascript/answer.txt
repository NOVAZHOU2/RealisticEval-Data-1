Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript function for your Python code:

```javascript
/**
 * Split the input text string into sentences.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The input text to be split into sentences.
 * @returns {Array<string>} - A list of sentences extracted from the input text, cleaned and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
 */
function splitIntoSentences(text) {
    // Regular expression to match sentence delimiters (periods, question marks, exclamation points)
    const sentenceDelimiters = /[.!?]/g;
    
    // Split the text into sentences based on the delimiters
    let sentences = text.split(sentenceDelimiters);
    
    // Filter out any empty strings that may result from consecutive delimiters or trailing spaces
    sentences = sentences.filter(sentence => sentence.trim() !== '');
    
    // Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each sentence
    sentences = sentences.map(sentence => sentence.trim());
    
    return sentences;
}
```

This JavaScript function `splitIntoSentences` takes a string `text` as an argument and returns an array of sentences, similar to what your Python function does. It uses regular expressions to identify sentence boundaries and then processes the resulting array to remove any empty strings and trim whitespace from each sentence.
