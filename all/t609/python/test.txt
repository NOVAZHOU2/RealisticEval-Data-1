Hereâ€™s the Java unit test code you provided, converted into Python code using the unittest framework. The conversion maintains the same functionality and logical structure as the original JUnit tests.
Converted Python Code using unittest
python
import unittest

class Answer:
    def two_sum(self, nums, target):
        nums_map = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums_map[nums[i]] = i
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in nums_map and nums_map[complement] != i:
                return [i, nums_map[complement]]
        raise ValueError("No two sum solution")

class TestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.answer = Answer()

    def test_valid_pair(self):
        nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
        target = 9
        expected = [0, 1]  # 2 + 7 = 9
        self.assertEqual(expected, self.answer.two_sum(nums, target))

    def test_negative_numbers(self):
        nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
        target = -8
        expected = [2, 4]  # -3 + -5 = -8
        self.assertEqual(expected, self.answer.two_sum(nums, target))

    def test_zero_sum(self):
        nums = [0, 4, 3, 0]
        target = 0
        expected = [0, 3]  # 0 + 0 = 0
        self.assertEqual(expected, self.answer.two_sum(nums, target))

    def test_no_solution(self):
        nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        target = 10
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
            self.answer.two_sum(nums, target)
        self.assertEqual("No two sum solution", str(context.exception))

    def test_same_number_twice(self):
        nums = [3, 3]
        target = 6
        expected = [0, 1]  # 3 + 3 = 6
        self.assertEqual(expected, self.answer.two_sum(nums, target))

    def test_large_numbers(self):
        nums = [2147483647, -2147483648, 0, 1]
        target = 1
        expected = [2, 3]  # 0 + 1 = 1
        self.assertEqual(expected, self.answer.two_sum(nums, target))

Breakdown of Changes
Imports:
The unittest module is imported for testing functionalities.
Class Definition:
The Tester class from Java is converted to TestAnswer in Python, which follows the naming conventions for test cases.
Setup Method:
The setUp method initializes an instance of the Answer class before each test, similar to the @Before annotation in JUnit.
Test Methods:
Each test method corresponds directly to the JUnit test methods but follows Python's naming convention (snake_case).
The assertion method assertArrayEquals in Java is replaced with assertEqual in Python, which checks for equality between two values.
Exception Testing:
In the test_no_solution method, the Java way of checking for exceptions (assertThrows) is replaced with assertRaises, using a context manager to capture the exception.
Handling Large Numbers:
The test for large integers uses Python's maximum and minimum integer values directly. The equivalent values for Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE are 2147483647 and -2147483648 respectively in Python.
Running the Tests
You can run this test suite by saving the code to a file (for example, test_answer.py) and executing it. You can run the tests using the command:
bash
python -m unittest test_answer.py
This will execute all the test cases and display the results in the terminal. If everything is correct, you should see that all tests pass.
