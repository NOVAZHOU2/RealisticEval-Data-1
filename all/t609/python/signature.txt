To convert the provided Java function signature to a Python function signature, we will translate the data types and modify the structure to follow Python conventions. Hereâ€™s how it looks:
Java Function Signature
java
/**
 * Finds two indices of numbers in the array that sum up to the target value.
 *
 * @param nums   the input array of integers
 * @param target the target sum value
 * @return an array containing the indices of the two numbers
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if no such indices are found
 */
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {}
Converted Python Function Signature
python
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Finds two indices of numbers in the array that sum up to the target value.

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The input array of integers.
        target (int): The target sum value.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list containing the indices of the two numbers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no such indices are found.
    """
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
Breakdown of Changes
Function Definition:
The public access modifier is omitted since Python does not have explicit access modifiers.
The method name is converted to snake_case (twoSum to two_sum).
Parameter Types:
int[] nums in Java is converted to list[int] in Python, indicating that nums is a list of integers.
int target remains int target since the type remains the same in both languages.
Return Type:
int[] return type in Java is converted to list[int] in Python, indicating a list of integers is returned.
Docstring:
The Java comments are transformed into a Python docstring, following Python conventions. The description now uses the Args, Returns, and Raises sections to document the function.
Exception Handling:
The IllegalArgumentException is replaced with ValueError in the docstring to reflect Python's conventions.
Implementation Placeholder:
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for where the function implementation would go.
This Python signature and docstring now provide clear information about the function's purpose and how it should be used, closely matching the intent of the original Java function.
