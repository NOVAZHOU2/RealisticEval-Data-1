Here’s the conversion of the provided TypeScript function to Python, maintaining the functionality and comments:
TypeScript Code
typescript
/**
 * Finds and returns the smallest letter in a sorted array that is larger than the given target letter.
 * If the target letter is greater than or equal to all letters in the array, the function returns the first letter in the array.
 *
 * @param {string[]} letters - A sorted array of letters.
 * @param {string} target - The target letter to find the next greatest letter for.
 * @returns {string} The smallest letter in the array that is larger than the target letter.
 */
export function nextGreatestLetter(letters: string[], target: string): string {
    let low: number = 0;
    let high: number = letters.length;
    
    // Perform binary search to find the smallest letter greater than the target
    while (low < high) {
        const mid: number = Math.floor(low + (high - low) / 2);
        // If the mid letter is less than or equal to the target, move to the right half
        if (letters[mid] <= target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, move to the left half
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the letter at the calculated position, wrapping around if necessary
    return letters[low % letters.length];
}
Python Code
Here’s the equivalent Python code:
python
def next_greatest_letter(letters: list[str], target: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds and returns the smallest letter in a sorted array that is larger than the given target letter.
    If the target letter is greater than or equal to all letters in the array, the function returns the first letter in the array.

    :param letters: A sorted array of letters.
    :param target: The target letter to find the next greatest letter for.
    :return: The smallest letter in the array that is larger than the target letter.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(letters)
    
    # Perform binary search to find the smallest letter greater than the target
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        # If the mid letter is less than or equal to the target, move to the right half
        if letters[mid] <= target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, move to the left half
            high = mid

    # Return the letter at the calculated position, wrapping around if necessary
    return letters[low % len(letters)]
Explanation of Changes:
Function Name:
Changed from nextGreatestLetter to next_greatest_letter to follow Python's naming conventions (PEP 8).
Function Parameters and Return Type:
The parameter types are adapted to Python, using list[str] for the list of letters and str for the target letter.
The return type is indicated with -> str.
Docstring:
Converted the JSDoc comments into a Python docstring, preserving the documentation style.
Binary Search Logic:
The logic remains the same, but the TypeScript specific syntax is replaced with Python syntax:
Math.floor() is replaced with the integer division operator //.
The initialization of mid directly uses the division without needing a function.
Return Statement:
The return statement uses Python's list indexing with the modulo operator %, which functions similarly to the TypeScript code.
This Python function should maintain the same functionality as the original TypeScript function. Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!
