To convert the TypeScript function signature to Python, we need to adjust the syntax for function declaration and type annotations. Python uses the def keyword to define a function, and for type hints, we use List[str] for lists of strings and str for individual strings. Here's the Python version of the given TypeScript signature, along with the function docstring:
python
from typing import List

def next_greatest_letter(letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds and returns the smallest letter in a sorted array that is larger than the given target letter.
    If the target letter is greater than or equal to all letters in the array, the function returns the first letter in the array.

    :param letters: A sorted array of letters.
    :param target: The target letter to find the next greatest letter for.
    :return: The smallest letter in the array that is larger than the target letter.
    """
    pass
Explanation:
List[str] corresponds to string[] in TypeScript, representing a list of strings.
str corresponds to string in TypeScript, representing a single string.
The function is named next_greatest_letter following Python's snake_case naming convention.
The docstring is kept similar to the original, with Python's format for describing parameters and return values.
