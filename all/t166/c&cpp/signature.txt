Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments reflecting the TypeScript version:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

/**
 * Finds and returns the smallest letter in a sorted array that is larger than the given target letter.
 * If the target letter is greater than or equal to all letters in the array, the function returns the first letter in the array.
 *
 * @param letters A sorted array of letters.
 * @param target The target letter to find the next greatest letter for.
 * @returns The smallest letter in the array that is larger than the target letter.
 */
std::string nextGreatestLetter(const std::vector<std::string>& letters, const std::string& target) {
    // Function implementation...
}
```

You can then implement the function body as previously provided.
