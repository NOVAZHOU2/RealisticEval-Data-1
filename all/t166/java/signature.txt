Here's the Java code signature with comments that correspond to your TypeScript function:

```java
/**
 * Finds and returns the smallest letter in a sorted array that is larger than the given target letter.
 * If the target letter is greater than or equal to all letters in the array, the function returns the first letter in the array.
 *
 * @param letters - A sorted array of letters.
 * @param target - The target letter to find the next greatest letter for.
 * @returns The smallest letter in the array that is larger than the target letter.
 */
public static char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The `export` keyword is omitted, as it is not used in Java.
- The parameter types are changed from `string[]` and `string` to `char[]` and `char`.
- The return type is changed from `string` to `char`. 

Feel free to fill in the implementation where indicated!
