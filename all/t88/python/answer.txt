To convert the JavaScript code into Python, we will use similar logic to split the cron expression and check if the hour part is between 2 and 4 AM.
Hereâ€™s the equivalent Python code:
python
def is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expression):
    # Split the cron expression by spaces
    parts = cron_expression.split(' ')
    
    # Get the hour part (second part in the cron expression)
    hour_part = parts[1]
    
    # Split the hour part by comma and convert it to a list of integers
    hours = list(map(int, hour_part.split(',')))
    
    # Check if any hour is between 2 (inclusive) and 4 (exclusive)
    return any(2 <= hour < 4 for hour in hours)

# Example usage
cron_expr = "0 2,3 * * *"
print(is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expr))  # Output: True

cron_expr = "0 1,5 * * *"
print(is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expr))  # Output: False
Explanation:
Split the Cron Expression: We split the cron expression by spaces (split(' ')) to separate the fields.
Get the Hour Part: The hour part is the second element in the cron expression (index 1).
Map to Integer: We split the hour part by commas (split(',')), then convert the resulting list of strings into a list of integers using map(int, ...).
Check Hours: We use the any() function to check if any of the hours in the list are greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4 (i.e., between 2:00 AM and 3:59 AM).
Example Outputs:
For cron_expr = "0 2,3 * * *", the function returns True because hours 2 and 3 are between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM.
For cron_expr = "0 1,5 * * *", the function returns False because neither 1 nor 5 are between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM.
