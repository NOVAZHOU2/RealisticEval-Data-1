To convert the provided JavaScript function signature and accompanying comments into a Python function signature with similar documentation, you can follow this structure:
python
def is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expression: str) -> bool:
    """
    Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.

    Args:
        cron_expression (str): The cron expression to parse.

    Returns:
        bool: True if any hour in the cron expression is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., False otherwise.
    """
    # Split the cron expression by spaces
    parts = cron_expression.split(' ')
    
    # Get the hour part (second part in the cron expression)
    hour_part = parts[1]
    
    # Split the hour part by comma and convert it to a list of integers
    hours = list(map(int, hour_part.split(',')))
    
    # Check if any hour is between 2 (inclusive) and 4 (exclusive)
    return any(2 <= hour < 4 for hour in hours)

# Example usage
cron_expr = "0 2,3 * * *"
print(is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expr))  # Output: True

cron_expr = "0 1,5 * * *"
print(is_cron_between_2_and_4_am(cron_expr))  # Output: False
Explanation of the Python Signature:
Function Name: The function name is_cron_between_2_and_4_am follows Python's naming conventions (snake_case).
Parameter Type: The parameter cron_expression is annotated with the type str, indicating that it expects a string input.
Return Type: The return type is annotated as bool, indicating that the function returns a boolean value.
Docstring: The docstring provides a description of the function, details about the parameter, and specifies the return value.
This Python function serves the same purpose as the original JavaScript function, parsing a cron expression and checking if it contains any hours between 2 AM and 4 AM.
