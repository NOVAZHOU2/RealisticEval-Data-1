Certainly! Hereâ€™s the equivalent C++ code signature with the comments preserved:

```cpp
/**
 * Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 * @param cronExpression
 */
bool isCronBetween2And4AM(const std::string& cronExpression) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `isCronBetween2And4AM` takes a `std::string` parameter named `cronExpression`.
   - It returns a `bool` indicating whether the cron expression specifies a time between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.

2. **Comments**:
   - The comments are preserved exactly as in the JavaScript version.

This signature can be used as a starting point for implementing the full functionality. If you need the implementation details as well, let me know!
