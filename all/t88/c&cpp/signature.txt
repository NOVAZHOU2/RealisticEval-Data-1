Hereâ€™s the C++ code signature with comments retained:

```cpp
/**
 * Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 * @param cronExpression The cron expression to parse.
 * @return true if the expression contains hours between 2 and 4, otherwise false.
 */
bool isCronBetween2And4AM(const std::string& cronExpression) {

}
``` 

You can fill in the function body as needed.
