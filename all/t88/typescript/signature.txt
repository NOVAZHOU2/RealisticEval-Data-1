To convert the JavaScript function signature to TypeScript while keeping the code comments, you can add type annotations. Hereâ€™s how it would look:

```typescript
/**
 * Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 * @param cronExpression - The cron expression to parse.
 * @returns True if the expression includes hours between 2 and 4 a.m., otherwise false.
 */
function isCronBetween2And4AM(cronExpression: string): boolean {

}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Parameter Type Annotation**: `cronExpression` is annotated as a `string`.
2. **Return Type Annotation**: The function's return type is specified as `boolean`.
3. **Updated Comments**: Added a brief description for the return value in the comments. 

This retains the original intent while providing type safety.
