Certainly! Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of the JavaScript code signature with the comments preserved:

```typescript
/**
 * Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 * @param cronExpression The cron expression to be parsed.
 * @returns {boolean} Whether the cron expression falls between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 */
function isCronBetween2And4AM(cronExpression: string): boolean {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript code:
- The function `isCronBetween2And4AM` now has a type annotation for the parameter `cronExpression` (`string`).
- The return type of the function is explicitly declared as `boolean`.
- The JSDoc comments are preserved and updated to include the return type description.

You can add the implementation inside the function body as needed.
