Here's the equivalent Java code signature with comments:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Divides a list evenly into n parts and returns a list of these parts. If the list length is not divisible by n,
 * additional elements are added to the previous sections one by one.
 *
 * @param lst the list to be divided
 * @param n   the number of parts to divide the list into
 * @return a list containing n sublists, where each sublist represents a part of the original list
 */
public static List<List<Integer>> divideList(List<Integer> lst, int n) {
```

Please note that in Java, you need to specify the type of elements in the list. In this case, I've used `Integer`, but you can replace it with any other type you need. Also, Java uses `static` keyword for methods that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class.
