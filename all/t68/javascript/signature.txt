Here's how you can convert the Python code signature to JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Divide a list evenly into n parts and return a list of these parts. If the list length is not divisible by n, additional elements are added to the previous sections one by one.
 * @param {Array} lst - The list to be divided.
 * @param {number} n - The number of parts to divide the list into.
 * @returns {Array} A list containing n sublists, where each sublist represents a part of the original list.
 */
```

In JavaScript, we use JSDoc for commenting and specify types using curly braces. Note that JavaScript does not have built-in type checking like Python, so the types in the comments are more for documentation purposes than enforcing them at runtime.
