/**
 * @brief Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 *
 * This function sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 * The algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and
 * swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.
 *
 * @param arr A reference to a vector of integers to be sorted.
