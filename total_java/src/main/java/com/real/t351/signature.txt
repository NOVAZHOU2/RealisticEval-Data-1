/**
 * Calculates the value of a cubic Bezier curve at a given parameter t.
 *
 * @param t  The parameter value between 0 and 1 that represents a position along the curve.
 * @param p0 The first control point of the curve, typically where the curve starts.
 * @param p1 The second control point, which influences the tangent at the beginning of the curve.
 * @param p2 The third control point, which influences the tangent at the end of the curve.
 * @param p3 The fourth control point, typically where the curve ends.
 * @return The point on the Bezier curve corresponding to the parameter t.
