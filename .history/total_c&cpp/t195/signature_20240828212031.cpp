/**
 * @brief Implement a floating-point stack structure based on arrays
 *
 * This class provides basic stack operations including push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.
 * The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array. If the stack reaches its maximum capacity, no more elements
 * can be pushed onto it until space is freed by popping elements.
