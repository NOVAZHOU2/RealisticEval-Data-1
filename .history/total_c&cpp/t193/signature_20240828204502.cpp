/**
 * @brief Inverts the flag bits of an unsigned integer and converts the result to a hexadecimal string.
 *
 * This function takes an unsigned integer as input, inverts its bits (i.e., flips all the bits),
 * and then converts the resulting integer to a hexadecimal string representation.
 *
 * @param value The unsigned integer whose bits are to be inverted.
 * @return A std::string containing the hexadecimal representation of the inverted bits.
